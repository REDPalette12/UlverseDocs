### **Backstory**

#### **The Rebellion Against Riley Non**

Veyron was once a spirited idealist who believed in the potential of Ulversian unity. However, when Riley Non rose to power, implementing policies that tightened control over the outlying settlements, Veyron saw it as a betrayal of Ulversian freedom. He joined a group of dissidents who sought to resist Non’s rule, using guerrilla tactics to disrupt his forces.

During a high-stakes mission to sabotage one of Non’s supply depots, Veyron and his group were cornered by Non’s elite forces. In a desperate bid to escape, Veyron stumbled upon a **Codehopper**—its owner already incapacitated in the chaos. Without hesitation, he activated the ship and fled, leaving his allies behind as Non’s forces closed in.

#### **A Life of Wandering**

Veyron’s escape marked the beginning of a long and solitary journey. Though he deeply regretted abandoning his comrades, he rationalized his actions as necessary for survival. Over the years, he wandered through countless dimensions and universes, using the **Ecliptic Stray** to evade pursuers and explore the unknown.

In his travels, Veyron met a variety of beings—some became friends, mentors, or temporary allies. His time on the run shaped him into a resourceful, if jaded, individual. Yet, even as the years passed, the weight of his betrayal and the unresolved fight against Riley Non haunted him.

---

### **The Present: The Message**

After decades of wandering, Veyron received an unexpected message from a passing Ulversian courier. It carried a stunning revelation: _Riley Non was no more._ The oppressive force that had driven him to exile had been defeated, and Ulversian society had begun to heal.

For the first time in years, Veyron felt hope—and the pull of home. He decided to return to **Caeluminor**, to face whatever remnants of his past awaited him and find peace with his choices.

---

### **Personality**

- **Cynical but Compassionate**: Veyron has seen too much to believe in simple ideals but retains a deep sense of empathy for those struggling under oppressive forces.
- **Resourceful**: Decades of wandering and surviving on his own have made him a master improviser, whether repairing the _Ecliptic Stray_ or navigating hostile territories.
- **Haunted**: He carries guilt for abandoning his comrades and doubts about whether he truly deserved the second chance he gave himself.

---

### **Appearance**

- **Build**: Lean and wiry, with the hardened look of someone who has lived a life on the run.
- **Eyes**: Piercing green with a faint glow, a trait from extended exposure to dimensional energy.
- **Clothing**: A patchwork coat made from various fabrics collected across dimensions, adorned with subtle Ulversian insignias as a quiet reminder of his origins.
- **Distinctive Mark**: A deep scar across his left forearm, earned during his final mission against Non.

---

### **The Ecliptic Stray (Codehopper)**

- **Exterior**: A battered but functional metallic orb, roughly the size of a phone booth, with glowing fractal lines running across its surface. The fractals occasionally shift patterns, reflecting the dimensional energies it has absorbed.
- **Interior**: A sprawling, dimly lit space with walls covered in holographic maps and mementos from his travels. The core chamber contains a multi-tiered control station surrounded by a hovering platform for mobility.
- **AI Name**: **LUXIS** (*L*inear *U*niversal e*X*ploration and *I*ntervention *S*ystem).
  - Personality: Pragmatic and no-nonsense, often serving as a counterbalance to Veyron’s impulsive tendencies.
  - Role: Manages navigation, rift generation, and security systems, while occasionally scolding Veyron for neglecting repairs.

   - A dimensionally-displaced engineer who helped Veyron repair the _Stray_ after a catastrophic rift jump. Thyra became a confidante and an occasional traveling companion.
2. **Orlin (Mentor)**:
   - An ancient, nomadic philosopher who taught Veyron the importance of forgiveness and the dangers of losing oneself to guilt.
3. **Lurae (Frenemy)**:
   - A cunning bounty hunter who once pursued Veyron but eventually formed a grudging alliance when they both needed to escape a collapsing dimension.

### **Veyron’s Return to Caeluminor**

- **Motivations**:
  - Veyron seeks to reconnect with his roots, atone for his perceived failures, and discover whether there’s still a place for him in Ulversian society.
- **Conflicts**:
