### **Riley Non**

- **Role**: Former Council Member (Advisor on Research and Development)
- **Family Name**: **Non**
- **Age**: Mid-40s at his fall
- **Focus**: Electricity Magic, Technological Experimentation
- **Overview**:  
  Riley Non was once a promising and brilliant figure in the Ulverse, a master of electricity magic and technological innovation who excelled in the Department of Research and Development. Known for his sharp mind and groundbreaking discoveries, Non was elevated to a position of power, replacing his predecessor. However, his appointment to the Council marked the beginning of his downfall.

  As a ruler, Non became consumed by his ego, abandoning the responsibilities he had been entrusted with. His neglect and hubris led to catastrophic failures in maintaining universal balance, resulting in the destruction of several universes. Survivors of these universes held him responsible and ultimately revolted, forcing the High Council to intervene. Non's banishment to the void inadvertently allowed the void being to escape, sparking the War of the Shining Vortex.

---

### **Personality**:

- **Before Power**:  
   Non was known as a creative genius and charismatic leader, admired for his innovative ideas and dedication to advancing the Ulverse’s knowledge.

- **After Gaining Power**:  
   Non’s rise to the Council brought out his darker traits. He became arrogant, dismissive of others, and increasingly self-absorbed, seeing himself as infallible.

- **During the Fall**:  
   Non’s reaction to the revolt was marked by cruelty and desperation. He lashed out at those who challenged him, using his mastery of electricity magic to suppress dissent, earning him infamy among the survivors.

---

### **Physical Appearance**:

- **Before Fall**: Non appeared polished and regal, with striking silver hair and glowing blue eyes reminiscent of lightning. He often wore intricately designed robes lined with pulsating threads of light, symbolizing his connection to electricity magic.

- **During the Fall**: His appearance became increasingly unkempt and disheveled. The glow in his eyes became harsh and almost erratic, mirroring his descent into madness.

---

### **Abilities**:

Riley Non’s mastery of electricity magic was unparalleled, and he used his abilities to devastating effect during his reign:

1. **Thunder Veil**:  
   A defensive spell that encased Non in a shroud of crackling lightning, making it nearly impossible for opponents to approach him without severe consequences.

2. **Stormcaller's Wrath**:  
   A destructive spell that summoned a massive, storm-like surge of electricity to obliterate entire areas, a technique he used mercilessly against rebels.

3. **Conductive Constructs**:  
   Non could imbue technology with electricity magic, creating powerful weapons or autonomous constructs to do his bidding.

4. **Arc Spikes**:  
   A rapid offensive ability, firing bolts of lightning that ricocheted unpredictably to strike multiple targets.

---

### **The Fall of Non**:

Non’s descent began when he started prioritizing his personal experiments over his responsibilities as a ruler. Universes under his care began to collapse due to his negligence, and survivors fled to nearby dimensions, forming a growing resistance against him.

The final straw came when Non deployed deadly constructs and unleashed massive storms on the rebels, further decimating already struggling populations. The High Council, led by Riley Ulu, stepped in after hearing the pleas of the survivors. Non was summoned to account for his actions but responded with defiance, blaming others for his failures.

His banishment to the Void was both a punishment and a necessity, as the Council feared he was too dangerous to leave unchecked. Unbeknownst to them, the Void Being capitalized on Non’s magical essence, merging with his body to escape and initiate the War of the Shining Vortex.

---

### **Legacy and Infamy**:

1. **Infamy in History**:  
   Non is remembered as one of the darkest chapters in Ulverse history. His name is often invoked as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and the responsibilities of power.

2. **The Survivors’ Pact**:  
   Survivors of the universes destroyed under Non’s reign formed a coalition known as the **Pact of the Shattered**, a group dedicated to preserving universal harmony and preventing similar tragedies.

3. **The War of the Shining Vortex**:  
   Non’s actions inadvertently released Umbra into the Ulverse, sparking a devastating war that reshaped Ulversian society. The war ended only when the Council and rulers worked together to contain the Void Being, transforming it into Umbra, the enigmatic observer.

---

### **Notable Traits and Actions**:

- **Innovator Turned Tyrant**: Non’s fall is often debated in historical circles, with some attributing it to his personality flaws and others to the pressures of power.
- **Relentless Combatant**: During the rebellion, Non fought viciously, refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of his opponents’ grievances.
- **Unintended Catalyst**: Despite his villainy, Non indirectly united the Ulverse against a common foe, leading to reforms in governance and magic oversight.

---

### **Key Relationships**:

- **With Riley Ulu**:  
   Ulu often reflects on Non’s fall as one of the greatest failures of his career, blaming himself for not recognizing the signs earlier.

- **With Riley Lan**:  
   Lan sees Non as a stark reminder of the responsibilities of leadership, driving his own dedication to research and development.

- **With Umbra**:  
   Umbra’s existence is intrinsically tied to Non, as the Void Being used his body as a vessel. This connection is a source of unease for many, as remnants of Non’s essence might still influence Umbra.

---

### **Quotes**:

- _“Progress waits for no one. If they cannot keep up, they deserve to be left behind.”_
- _“Power is not given. It is seized by those who prove they are worthy.”_
- _“The void is silent, and yet it echoes my failures endlessly.”_

---

### **Potential Redemption Arc**:

While Non is widely condemned, there is speculation among scholars and mystics about the potential for his redemption. Some believe that fragments of his essence remain within the Void or Umbra and could one day seek absolution. Others dismiss this as wishful thinking, arguing that Non’s actions left scars too deep to heal.

### **Lingering Influence of Riley Non**

Though Riley Non was banished to the Void and seemingly eradicated as an individual, the echoes of his actions and essence left a lasting mark on the Ulverse. His influence persisted in the following ways:

---

### **1. Legacy of Distrust and Reforms**

- **Mistrust of Leadership**:  
   Non’s reign and subsequent banishment caused widespread skepticism toward the Council of Eight. Survivors of destroyed universes were particularly vocal, questioning whether the rulers were truly capable of safeguarding the Ulverse.

- **Reforms in Governance**:  
   To restore trust, the **Ulverse High Council** implemented stricter oversight of the Council of Eight. They also introduced measures to evaluate potential rulers more rigorously, emphasizing not only their magical prowess but also their character and dedication to their duties.

- **Increased Accountability**:  
   Departments like Research and Development were restructured to prevent neglect of universal care. Lan's eventual appointment was part of this reform, symbolizing a shift toward diligence and integrity.

---

### **2. Fragmented Survivors’ Psyche**

- **The Shattered Peoples**:  
   Survivors of the universes destroyed under Non’s neglect experienced immense trauma. While groups like the **Pact of the Shattered** formed to rebuild, many individuals carried deep emotional scars, struggling with survivor’s guilt, distrust of authority, or rage at their lost homes.
  Myths and cultural stories of these survivors often feature themes of betrayal and loss, with Non as the central villain. These tales became cautionary narratives about unchecked ambition and the responsibilities of leadership.

---

### **3. Residual Magical Imprint**

- **Non's Electrical Constructs**:  
   Some remnants of Non’s magical creations still linger in abandoned universes. These constructs—electrified automata or storm-bound artifacts—are dangerous and volatile. They often act as ghostly reminders of Non’s experiments, attacking any who intrude on their ruined territories.

- **Void Corruption**:  
   When the Void Being merged with Non, traces of the Void’s energy seeped into the fabric of the Ulverse. Certain dimensions affected by the Shining Vortex still bear scars of this corruption, manifesting as anomalies like spontaneous storms, erratic magical fields, or unstable dimensional rifts.

- **Umbra’s Presence**:  
   Umbra, the transformed Void Being, is a living testament to Non’s failure. Though detached and enigmatic, Umbra’s mere existence unnerves many, especially survivors who cannot separate its current state from Non’s destructive legacy.

---

### **4. Inspiration for Vigilantism and Activism**

- **Rise of Independent Protectors**:  
   In the aftermath of Non's destruction, many individuals took it upon themselves to protect dimensions independently of the Council. These self-appointed guardians often view the Ulversian rulers with suspicion, believing their intervention is insufficient.

- **Art and Literature**:  
   Non’s actions inspired countless works of art, from tragic epics to cautionary fables. These pieces often serve as both a warning against hubris and a tribute to the resilience of those who endured his reign.
