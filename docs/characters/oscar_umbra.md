## **Backstory**

(A brief or detailed summary of the characterâ€™s history, including major life events and how they became who they are.)

## **Additional Notes**

Has three forms, his human 'Shell' Form, his 'Distortion' Form and his True form. \
To transition from his 'Shell' Form to his 'Distortion' Form he tears his Sealing core from his chest, and his human 'shell' breaks in half and crumbles away, leaving his distortion form.
While in his distortion form he retains his human shape but gains his true form's 'shadow' appearance, only his eyes being visible. His main attack while in this form is a mass of hand-Like,
shadow appendages that he creates from his shadow body. While in this form he is more aggressive and is usually very narrow minded, not stopping his attack until his target is destroyed. \
When he first had his void energy sealed within his Sealing Core he was an emotionless being and had to learn about the world around him, similar to a child despite having all the memories of when he was just The Void.
It took a while but he eventually got to the point where he understood basic emotions and how to interact with people. He still struggles to this day to discern feelings of love, friendship, happiness and other positive emotions due to the nature of The Void being essentially Anti-matter and as such is the 'negative' imprint of reality. This is shown by the fact that he still has a distain for people and the fact that he has very few people that he connects with or gets along with.
