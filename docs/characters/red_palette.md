### **Red Palette’s Signature Invention**

One story not tied to a specific myth but highly regarded in Ulversian culture is how **Red Palette** improved magical theory using his combination of the **Luminous Quill** and the **Staff of the Eternal Lamp**.

**The Story**:  
Red Palette used the quill to develop a spell format called **Lightweaving**, where spells could be written mid-battle using glowing diagrams in the air. His mastery of the quill, paired with the staff’s stabilizing light, allowed him to codify this technique and train future Ulversians in **combat spellcraft**.

**Legacy**:

- This innovation transformed how Ulversians approached magic, merging intellect with adaptability.
- Red Palette’s combination of tools became an aspirational standard for mages who seek to blend creativity with raw power.
