### **Red Palette’s Signature Invention**

One story not tied to a specific myth but highly regarded in Ulversian culture is how **Red Palette** improved magical theory using his combination of the **Luminous Quill** and the **Staff of the Eternal Lamp**.

**The Story**:  
Red Palette used the quill to develop a spell format called **Lightweaving**, where spells could be written mid-battle using glowing diagrams in the air. His mastery of the quill, paired with the staff’s stabilizing light, allowed him to codify this technique and train future Ulversians in **combat spellcraft**.

**Legacy**:

- This innovation transformed how Ulversians approached magic, merging intellect with adaptability.
- Red Palette’s combination of tools became an aspirational standard for mages who seek to blend creativity with raw power.

### **Red Palette and Insight Overload Disorder**

- **Afflicted Individual**: Red Palette, the head of the **Research Department**, is one of the most famous Ulverse Elves with Insight Overload Disorder.

- **Adaptation**:

  - He wears his custom **Dampening Spectacles**, intricately crafted with starstone lenses and nebula ore frames. These spectacles filter excessive energy, allowing him to control the flow of insights.
  - While wearing the spectacles, he can toggle the level of insight depending on the task, though it’s still taxing to use for long periods.

- **Reputation**:

  - Red Palette is both admired and feared for his ability to "see through" people and objects.
  - His disorder makes him an unparalleled researcher and artifact analyst, as he can instantly discern the properties and history of magical items.

- **Drawbacks in Leadership**:
  - His disorder sometimes activates during social interactions, unintentionally revealing private details about his colleagues, which has strained relationships in the past.
  - This has led him to adopt a solitary lifestyle, focusing on his work while avoiding large gatherings or overly emotional situations.
