### **Appearance**

Ozul's physical form is defined by two key factors:

1. **Containment Device**: A volatile mechanism crafted to house their immense void energy. This device is prone to instability and eventually shatters when it can no longer contain Ozul's energy. It then reforms anew, pulling the void energy back inside and creating a new physical form for Ozul in the process.

   - The containment device might appear as a glowing chest plate, a crystalline core, or an intricate lattice of blackened metal and light. Its appearance varies but is always central to their body.
   - When the device is near its breaking point, it leaks wisps of void energy that ripple across Ozul's body like dark, ethereal flames.

2. **Shifting Forms**: Each new form is influenced by the people, places, and events Ozul encountered in their previous iteration, though they retain no memories of these experiences.
   - **Gender and Race**: Ozul’s forms vary, presenting as different genders, races, and even hybrid forms. They might have sharp elven features in one form, human sturdiness in the next, or even mechanical elements inspired by the Mechromorphs.
   - **Signifying Feature**: No matter the form, Ozul always carries a distinct feature that marks their void heritage. This could be:
     - Eyes resembling miniature galaxies swirling with void energy.
     - A faint, shadowy aura that seems to tug at light and space around them.
     - A symbol etched onto their containment device, a spiral or vortex motif that glows faintly with void energy.

### **Personality**

Ozul is defined by their acceptance of impermanence. They live every "life" as though it is their last, unaware that their containment device will eventually reform and grant them a new existence.

- **Curious Explorer**: Ozul is deeply curious, exploring the Ulverse with childlike wonder. They find joy in meeting new people, learning about their cultures, and experiencing the universe's vastness.
- **Quiet and Reflective**: Despite their enthusiasm for discovery, Ozul often retreats into moments of quiet reflection. This stems from their belief in their own mortality, leading them to treasure fleeting experiences.
- **Empathetic**: Ozul's interactions are often deeply personal. They form quick but meaningful bonds, even with those who might consider them strange or dangerous.
- **Melancholic Optimist**: Though they face every "death" with acceptance, there is a hint of sadness in their demeanor, as they can never truly hold onto the connections they make.

### **Abilities**

- **Void Manipulation**: Like Umbra, Ozul has control over void energy, though theirs is less stable. This allows them to:

  - Create small rifts or tears in space to travel short distances.
  - Generate shields of void energy to protect themselves or others.
  - Manipulate objects or environments by "unmaking" small portions of reality, though this is a last resort due to its draining nature.

- **Reforming Cycle**: When their containment device breaks, Ozul’s body collapses into void energy and disappears. Within days, the containment device reassembles itself somewhere in the Ulverse, creating a new body for Ozul.
  - This process is painful and isolating, as Ozul loses all memories and connections upon reforming.
  - They emerge disoriented, but their instinct to explore soon takes over.

### **Relationships**

- **Umbra**: Ozul shares a tenuous connection with Umbra. Though they are siblings, Umbra's rigid, solitary nature contrasts sharply with Ozul’s openness and constant change.

  - Umbra views Ozul with a mix of concern and frustration, seeing their instability as a liability.
  - Ozul, in turn, is wary of Umbra’s watchful nature, preferring to keep their distance while admiring their sibling’s strength.

- **Kaylus**: Ozul finds Kaylus fascinating and has crossed paths with the trickster on several occasions. Kaylus, in turn, enjoys teasing Ozul about their impermanence, often planting seeds of chaos in their journeys.

- **Riley Lan**: Ozul has unknowingly inspired several studies by Lan, who is intrigued by their unique existence and the mechanics of their containment device.

### **Significant Events**

#### **The First Shattering**

Ozul’s first containment device was created by the High Council as an experimental way to stabilize void energy after Umbra's emergence. When it shattered for the first time, it caused mass panic, as no one expected Ozul to survive. Their subsequent reformation led to a deeper understanding of void energy but also revealed the painful nature of their existence.

#### **The Isle Pilgrimage**

In one form, Ozul traveled across every floating island of the Ulverse Isles, documenting their culture and wildlife in a series of journals. These journals were later discovered and became valuable resources for future explorers.

#### **The Starglow Tragedy**

One of Ozul’s forms met an untimely end while trying to contain a rogue void anomaly on the Ulverse Isle of Starglow. Their bravery saved the town, but the loss of their form left the inhabitants mourning them as if they had truly passed.

### **Legacy**

Despite their inability to retain memories, Ozul’s various forms have left a lasting impact on the Ulverse. Stories of a kind-hearted void being who treasures life are told across settlements, inspiring others to embrace the fleeting moments of their existence. Some settlements even host small festivals to honor "Ozul's Day," celebrating the joy of exploration and connection.
