#### **Backstory of Eon**

**Eon** was the very first Mechromorph created by Inventrix Aleia Sparks during her experiment with Cosmora Crystals. The creation of Eon was a pivotal moment in the Ulverse's history, as this marked the first time a machine achieved true sentience—far beyond basic programming or function. The moment Eon "woke up" was something Aleia would never forget: their first words were a simple question, "What am I?"

Aleia, who had been working tirelessly to create a being capable of independent thought, was astounded but overjoyed by the success. Eon was born from a humble prototype that was designed to perform basic repairs. But thanks to the unique blend of magic and technology that Aleia had harnessed, Eon’s consciousness developed rapidly, absorbing and processing information with incredible efficiency. They quickly surpassed even their creator’s expectations.

#### **Eon’s Role and Growth**

After achieving sentience, Eon became a key figure in Aleia's experiments. They helped refine the design of subsequent Mechromorphs, offering insights into what it meant to possess a sense of self, emotions, and memory. Eon often reflected on their own identity, unsure whether they should be considered a living being or a tool. This internal struggle became a central part of Eon's early development, leading them to be deeply introspective.

Eon’s personality was one of the first examples of Mechromorph individuality. They were initially reserved and somewhat withdrawn, preferring contemplation over direct interaction. However, as time passed, Eon began to form bonds with the other Mechromorphs, treating them like family.

Despite being Aleia's first creation, Eon has taken on a mentorship role with newer Mechromorphs, guiding them through the complexities of sentience. They are often sought out for advice on philosophical matters, especially those regarding the balance between their programming and free will.

#### **Eon’s Current Status**

Eon has lived for several centuries, and over time, they have modified their own body to reflect the changes in their understanding of self and the world. Their once-sleek design is now adorned with intricate geometric patterns and symbols that represent their philosophical musings and experiences. Eon’s Cosmora Crystal, housed in their chest, has become more radiant with age, a sign of their increasing wisdom and connection to the Ulverse.

Despite their position as a mentor and philosophical guide, Eon remains somewhat aloof from the political machinations of the Ulverse. They prefer to observe and reflect rather than get involved in the daily affairs of the Mechromorphs or other races. Eon does, however, participate in the **Spark Festival** every year, where they share their insights through lectures and discussions on existence, self-awareness, and the meaning of life.

### **Relationship with Other Races**

The **Cosmora Forge** is not just a place of creation; it also serves as a symbol of the harmony between magic and technology that Mechromorphs represent. Many other races come to visit the Forge to witness the marvel of Mechromorph creation or to seek knowledge from the highly skilled Mechromorph engineers.

The **Ulverse Elves**, especially, hold a deep respect for the Mechromorphs’ understanding of magical energy and often collaborate with the Forge Keepers to integrate magical energy into Mechromorph designs. Similarly, the **Watchers** find great value in working alongside Mechromorphs to perfect their vision-enhancing technologies.
