### **Kaylus, The Eternal Showman**

Kaylus is a uniquely chaotic and enigmatic Collective Existence whose nature defies traditional Ulversian norms. Born of the energy woven into each universe, Kaylus possesses a single shared mind that exists simultaneously across all his bodies. These bodies emerge spontaneously in universes at varying times, ensuring Kaylus has a constant presence somewhere in the vastness of the Ulverse. His true motivation? Pure, unadulterated entertainment—for himself, regardless of the consequences.

### **Kaylus’ Traits and Characteristics**

#### **Appearance**

- **General Form**: Kaylus' bodies are humanoid, but their features vary between universes. Some appear as sharp-featured individuals with angular cheekbones, while others have a softer, more approachable visage. Despite the diversity, two unchanging traits mark him:

  - **Fox-Like Eyes**: His golden, slitted eyes resemble those of a cunning fox, a subtle but unmistakable sign of his identity.
  - **Fox Insignia**: A symbol resembling a stylized fox is always visible somewhere on his attire. It might appear embroidered into a jacket, dangling as a pendant, or even tattooed onto his skin.

- **Cane as an Accessory**: Whether ornamental or functional, Kaylus always carries a cane. Typically, these canes are ornately designed with universes’ distinct aesthetics, but they all share a hidden feature—a secret compartment or weapon that aligns with his playful nature.

- **Showmanship in Style**: His clothing tends to lean toward theatrical and extravagant, tailored to draw attention. Think Victorian suits, flowing capes, or richly colored fabrics—but he adapts to blend in when necessary.

#### **Personality**

- **Chaotic Entertainer**: Kaylus thrives on excitement and unpredictability, constantly seeking situations to alleviate his boredom. His antics range from harmless pranks to elaborate schemes that may destabilize entire universes.
- **Amoral Observer**: He is not evil, but his moral compass is dictated solely by what he finds entertaining. This has made him both a nuisance and a dangerous entity in the eyes of many Ulversians.
- **Master Manipulator**: Kaylus delights in weaving intricate games, often dragging others into his schemes. He is charming and persuasive, making it difficult for people to resist his influence.

#### **Abilities**

- **Rebirth in Universes**: When one of Kaylus’ bodies dies, a new one is born elsewhere in a different universe. This ensures his perpetual presence in the Ulverse.
- **Universal Knowledge**: Kaylus instinctively knows the nuances of each universe he inhabits, granting him an edge when it comes to exploiting their rules or weaknesses.
- **Disguise and Illusion**: Kaylus can alter his appearance, but his fox-like eyes and the fox insignia are telltale signs for those who know to look.
- **Cane Magic**: His canes are more than accessories—they often act as foci for his chaotic energy, enabling him to create dazzling illusions, disrupt spells, or unleash blasts of cosmic mischief.

### **Kaylus’ Backstory**

Kaylus is believed to have originated during the _Ulverse Era_ as an unintended byproduct of the Ulverse Core's expansion. When the Core spread its energy to create the multiverse, it inadvertently infused the essence of curiosity and chaos into a single consciousness. This consciousness became Kaylus—a being with no allegiance to order or destruction, existing purely to experience and instigate.

Over the eras, Kaylus has been both a myth and a very real problem. Some universes consider him a trickster god, while others label him a demon of mischief. His involvement in historical events has ranged from subtle nudges that changed destinies to outright catastrophic meddling.

### **Kaylus’ Role in the Ulverse Isles**

Kaylus rarely resides on the Ulverse Isles for long, preferring the chaos of the wider multiverse. However, when he does appear, it’s usually for one of three reasons:

1. **A Grand Scheme**: Kaylus might set up elaborate games or trials, often luring unwitting participants into his “entertainment.”
2. **To Relieve Boredom**: The Isles’ unique energy and diverse population occasionally fascinate him, prompting him to stir up trouble.
3. **Ulversian Interest**: Some Ulversians actively seek him out, either to stop his schemes or to understand his abilities better.

### **Relationships with Other Figures**

- **Riley Lan**: Lan sees Kaylus as a frustrating but fascinating anomaly. He has attempted to study Kaylus, but the showman’s refusal to stay still for long makes him an elusive subject.
- **Red Palette**: Red is highly suspicious of Kaylus, believing his chaotic nature could harm the delicate balance of the Ulverse. However, Kaylus admires Red's ingenuity and occasionally tries to rope him into schemes.
- **Umbra**: Kaylus respects Umbra’s antisocial tendencies and sometimes seeks out the Void Being for philosophical discussions—much to Umbra’s irritation.
- **The Watchers**: Kaylus enjoys toying with the Watchers, especially Ain, whom he views as overly serious. However, he avoids pushing them too far, as he doesn’t want to lose his freedom.

### **Events Surrounding Kaylus**

#### **The Splintered Spiral**

One of Kaylus’ most infamous incidents occurred during the _Era of Reconstruction_, when he created a multiverse-wide game known as the Splintered Spiral. The event involved powerful artifacts scattered across the cosmos, each tied to bizarre, chaotic consequences when used. Entire universes participated, but the consequences of Kaylus’ “game” were catastrophic, leading to the destruction of several worlds before it was stopped by Riley Oro.

#### **The Shifting Masks**

In the _Era of the Shining Vortex_, Kaylus aided the Watchers during a critical battle by providing them with enchanted masks that enhanced their vision. However, the masks came with an ironic twist—they forced the wearers to witness Kaylus’ pranks through visions, leaving many frustrated but reluctantly grateful.

### **Kaylus’ Legacy**

Kaylus is as much a force of nature as a being, and his presence leaves a lasting impression wherever he goes. Despite his chaotic tendencies, many Ulversians acknowledge the peculiar wisdom hidden in his actions. He embodies the Ulverse’s complexity—a balance of creativity and chaos, of unpredictability and ingenuity.

### **Ozul Umbra, The Wanderer of Forms**

Ozul Umbra, sibling to Umbra, is a being born from the void energy that defines their kin. Unlike Umbra, who embodies control and watchfulness, Ozul represents the fluidity of existence and the transient nature of identity. They are a humanoid void being, but their ever-shifting forms make them an enigma even among their own kind.
