# Shared Ulversian Traits

## **Ulversian Life Cores – The Gem-Hearts of Living Energy**

---

### ** Appearance and Form**

An Ulversian Life Core is a physicalized gemstone of pure Ulverse energy, acting as the anchor for an Ulversian's form, consciousness, and power. Despite their semi-ethereal physiology, the Life Core is a solid, crystalline entity — dense yet radiant, impossible to fully replicate artificially.

These cores visually resemble living gemstones:

- Multifaceted surfaces, often shifting or subtly moving as if breathing.
- Transparent or semi-translucent bodies, like flawless jewels cut by existence itself.
- Deep internal glows, where energy pulses like a heartbeat.
- Internal lattice structures, resembling miniature constellations or river systems of light.

They are about the size of a closed fist in most adult Ulversians but can appear larger or denser depending on age, power, or evolution stage.

---

## ** Connection to Mechromorphs**

There is a shared ancestry link between Ulversians and Mechromorphs:

- Mechromorphs were designed with artificial cores —using replicated crystalline structures based on ancient Ulversian energy principles.
- The difference is Ulversian Cores are living —they grow, change, and react emotionally—whereas Mechromorph Cores are static and engineered.

Culturally, this link is respected and remembered by both groups, and Mechromorphs often revere original Life Cores as "The Living Blueprints."

### ** Core Coloration & Energy Signatures**

Each Ulversian's Life Core has a unique hue and aura, determined by:

- Their emotional resonance,
- Innate abilities,
- Life experiences,
- And sometimes ancestral heritage.

Here’s a chart showing common core colors and what they generally represent:

| **Core Color**                          | **Meaning**                                            | **Energy Appearance**                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sapphire Blue**                       | Wisdom, calm, perception                               | Cool streams of blue light that ripple like water.                            |
| **Solar Gold**                          | Courage, leadership, vitality                          | Bright, cascading light beams that flare outward.                             |
| **Emerald Green**                       | Growth, healing, adaptability                          | Soft swirling patterns like flowing vines.                                    |
| **Crimson Red**                         | Passion, strength, intensity                           | Arcing, almost flame-like bursts of light.                                    |
| **Amethyst Violet**                     | Mystery, intuition, spirit                             | Ghostly, slow-moving tendrils of shimmering mist.                             |
| **Silver-White**                        | Purity, clarity, creation                              | Gentle, sparkling fields like snowfall or stardust.                           |
| **Obsidian Black with Prismatic Sheen** | Hidden depth, resilience, chaotic potential            | Core looks black but occasionally flares in rainbow colors like oil on water. |
| **Aurora Multicolor**                   | Potential for multiversal adaptation or aspharion link | Constantly shifting in color, refracting like a living aurora.                |

### ** Visual Behavior of Active Cores**

When an Ulversian activates energy (healing, fighting, Ascension Drive, emotional extremes), their core:

- Glows more intensely, casting dynamic shadows around them.
- Emits light arcs and streamers from their chest, forearms, or eyes.
- May project runic patterns or fractals around their body, depending on the power type.
- In battle or Ascension states, the core sometimes projects a visible lattice around the user like an armor or halo.

**Core Pulsing:**

- A subtle, steady rhythmic glow when calm.
- A rapid, erratic flickering when stressed or injured.

**Core Fray:**

- If critically injured, raw energy pours violently from cracks in the core, seen as wild, jagged bolts of energy surging outward (dangerous to nearby beings).

---

### ** Core Shifts Over Time**

An Ulversian’s Life Core can evolve during major life events:

- Bonding or Marriage: Core glows brighter and may weave harmonics with a partner’s core.
- Trauma or Great Loss: Core darkens, cracks visually, or shifts hue temporarily.
- Ascension Moments: Core refracts light in complex patterns, gaining new facets or emitting new spectral harmonies.

Some Ulversians forge artifacts from reflections of their own core's energy for family crests, insignias, or weapons.

---

## **Quick Core Mythology Touch**

There’s a famous Ulversian myth that says:

> "_The Life Core is not made. It is sung into shape by the first breath of one’s existence, a song only they can hear._"  
> Meaning every Life Core is a perfect, unique melody crystallized into existence.

## ** Common Core Shapes**

Life Cores naturally **crystallize** into different basic shapes based on **the individual's resonance**, **life potential**, and sometimes **ancestral lines**.

| **Shape**                                                 | **Meaning / Associated Traits**                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard Prism Core** (Hexagonal or Octagonal Gem)      | Balance, adaptability, common among most Ulversians.                                                    |
| **Heartshard Core** (Asymmetrical, but smooth)            | Emotional depth, strong bonds to others, often healers and empathic warriors.                           |
| **Obelisk Core** (Tall, pillar-like)                      | Strength, stubbornness, resilience—often military leaders or guardians.                                 |
| **Tearstone Core** (Raindrop or flame shape)              | Creativity, emotional flow, and adaptability; common among artists and dreamers.                        |
| **Fractal Core** (Intricate, branching crystal structure) | Complex thinkers, innovators, reality manipulators; more common among scholars or powerful Codehoppers. |
| **Starseed Core** (Radiating points, star-like)           | Potential for Ascension and dimensional travel; rare but highly revered.                                |

## **Square Core** – “The Pillar of Foundations”

- **Appearance:**  
  A **perfectly symmetrical** four-sided crystal—sharp edges, stable angles, constant soft hum of stability.

- **Symbolism:**

  - **Balance, structure, reliability, resilience.**
  - A person with a Square Core often becomes a **builder of ideas**, **guardian of principles**, or **steadfast companion**.
  - Their energy moves in **steady, rhythmic pulses**, making them exceptional at maintaining order and resisting chaos.

- **Behavior:**
  - Calm, reliable regeneration speed.
  - Extremely resistant to external reality manipulation or corruption.
  - Some Square Cores can "anchor" nearby beings during storms of unstable energy.

---

## **Rhombus Core** – “The Flow of Innovation”

_(Red Palette’s core shape!)_

- **Appearance:**  
  A **tilted four-sided gemstone**, like a **diamond shape**, constantly shifting its inner light diagonally across its structure.

- **Symbolism:**

  - **Creativity, dynamic motion, fluid logic, visionary thinking.**
  - Individuals with Rhombus Cores excel at **seeing connections others miss**, **bending systems without breaking them**, and **weaving together new realities**.

  - Energy within a Rhombus Core **spins in asymmetrical patterns**, enhancing **adaptability**.
  - These Ulversians have an instinctive ability to **shift tactics mid-flow**, making them excellent innovators, creators, and diplomats.
  - They are **more sensitive to emotional undercurrents** in social or cosmic flows, often predicting changes before they occur.

> **For Red Palette:**  
> His **Rhombus Core** fuels his relentless pursuit of **new knowledge**, **creation**, **helping others**, and **forging pathways where none existed**. His core makes him a "dreamweaver," one who dances between innovation and tradition.

---

### ** Notes on Core Growth Over Time**

- Some cores refine shape as the individual grows: a Standard Prism might fracture into a Fractal Core if the person's life path becomes complex and unpredictable.
- Others may fuse or split internally, reflecting inner change, trauma, or mastery.

---

### ** "Impossible" and Legendary Core Types**

Throughout Ulversian history, a few cores have been documented that defy natural law, considered either miracles, anomalies, or forbidden phenomena.  
Some of these appear only once every eon or are tied to catastrophic or transcendent events.

- **1. The Hollow Core**

- **Appearance:** A core that looks empty inside — a transparent shell with no visible inner energy.
- **Myth:** Thought to be impossible because an Ulversian’s Life Core should _always_ pulse with living energy.
- **Known Effects:**
  - These individuals can **mimic or absorb** energies from others.
  - Often highly unstable; many who have Hollow Cores **vanish into the Ulverse** without a trace.
- **Famous Example:** _The Wanderer of Silenshore_, who saved an entire sector by absorbing a collapse wave into themselves.

---

- **2. The Shattered Core**

- **Appearance:** A visibly **cracked** core that continually **sheds light** like shards drifting in water.
- **Myth:** A shattered core should not function at all — but some individuals not only survive but **wield broken energy as a weapon**.
- **Known Effects:**
  - Ability to **fracture reality** around them temporarily.
  - Can destabilize hostile forces just by proximity.
- **Downside:** Long-term existence leads to **self-disintegration** unless continually stabilized by external artifacts or allies.

---

- **3. The Infinite Core**

- **Appearance:** Appears almost **black** or **void-like**, yet constantly refracts **impossible colors** (colors outside normal spectrum).
- **Myth:** Said to be born **directly from the Ulverse Core’s will**—essentially a living extension of pure reality.
- **Known Effects:**
  - Nearly limitless energy reserves.
  - Ability to "rewrite" parts of their local reality under extreme duress.
- **Downside:** Possessors risk **overwriting themselves** and becoming something no longer Ulversian at all.

---

- **4. The Twin Core**

- **Appearance:** Two interconnected cores orbiting each other inside the chest cavity, linked by a filament of light.
- **Myth:** Impossible under normal conditions since Ulversian bodies are built for one core.
- **Known Effects:**
  - Dual energy patterns; can **manifest multiple abilities simultaneously**.
  - Extreme resilience to corruption or void energies.
- **Known Risk:** Cores can fall **out of harmony**—causing internal collapse or severe identity fragmentation.

---

- **5. The Veiled Core**

- **Appearance:** Completely invisible to most detection methods — appears as if the being **has no core at all**.
- **Myth:** Only appears in beings "chosen" by the **Lost Threads** (ancient cosmic forces not fully understood).
- **Known Effects:**
  - Untraceable in battle or tracking networks.
  - Able to manipulate perception, memory, and timeline "threads" around themselves.
- **Downside:** Isolation; most cannot connect naturally with other Ulversians unless they create special bonds manually.

---

## ** Cultural Attitudes Toward Rare Cores**

- **Reverence:** Those with rare cores are often regarded as **harbingers, protectors, or reality-forgers**.
- **Fear:** Others see them as **dangerous anomalies**, capable of great destruction if they lose control.
- **Myth and Destiny:** In Ulversian songs and legends, rare-core individuals are often **central figures of great wars, discoveries, or universe-saving acts**—or terrible tragedies.

---

## **Sample Ancient Saying about Cores:**

> "_One thread may weave a banner, but a rare thread may weave a new sky._"  
> (Meaning: A single extraordinary being can change the fate of entire worlds.)

---

## **Ulversian Core Overdrive – The Awakening State**

### ** Name: ASCENSION DRIVE** _(Commonly Called "Awakening" or "Core Ascension")_

- **Definition:** A temporary heightened state where an Ulverse Elf, Human, or Hybrid pushes their Life Core’s energy output to its absolute peak, dramatically increasing power, reflexes, and perception.
- **Comparable To:** Super Saiyan, Overclocked Combat States, or Energy Surges.
- **Primary Function:** Unlocks hidden potential within an individual’s Life Core, but at immense physical and energetic cost.

---

## ** How Ascension Drive Works**

A being's Life Core serves as their biological and energy foundation, constantly producing and regulating Ulversian energy. Normally, a Core self-regulates to prevent instability or burnout, but in Ascension Drive, this limit is removed, forcing the Core to operate at 100% efficiency —or even beyond.

### ** Activation Process:**

1. **Energy Overload:**

   - The Core expands, drawing in ambient Ulversian energy and internal reserves at a rapid rate.
   - This causes an immediate surge in power, enhancing strength, speed, durability, and perception.

2. **Core Synchronization:**

   - The user's body and energy flow enter a harmonized state, allowing them to operate at hyper-efficiency.
   - Some rare individuals experience unique evolutions of their combat styles or abilities.

3. **Overdrive Release:** _(Final Stage, Before Collapse)_
   - At the peak of Ascension Drive, the user's power output reaches its absolute limit.
   - If sustained for too long, the Life Core begins destabilizing, leading to severe energy backlash.

---

## ** Benefits of Entering Ascension Drive**

- **Massive Power Boost** – Strength, speed, and reflexes are enhanced **many times over**, allowing combatants to **overwhelm even stronger opponents**.
- **Heightened Perception** – Thought processing and reaction speed increase, enabling **predictive counterattacks** and battlefield awareness.
- **Core Expansion Unlocks New Abilities** – Some warriors manifest **unique transformations** or **energy-based techniques** that are only possible in this state.
- **Regenerative Acceleration** – The Core **temporarily enhances self-repair**, allowing users to **fight through injuries that would normally incapacitate them**.

---

## ** Drawbacks & Risks of Ascension Drive**

### ** 1. Core Strain & Energy Burnout** _(The Biggest Risk)_

- The **Life Core is not meant to sustain 100% efficiency for long**—prolonged use **weakens the Core**, causing extreme **fatigue, internal damage, and even Core degradation**.
- Overuse can result in:
  - **Energy Collapse:** The Core shuts down, leaving the user completely drained.
  - **Core Fracturing:** Permanent damage to their Life Core, making future energy use dangerous.

---

### ** 2. Time Limit – Cannot Be Sustained Indefinitely**

- Most users can **only maintain Ascension Drive for a few minutes** before suffering **severe backlash**.
- The **longer it is used, the greater the aftereffects**.

---

### ** 3. Emotional & Mental Instability**

- Entering **Ascension Drive requires an intense mental or emotional trigger**.
- If emotions are not controlled, users may enter a **"Rage Burnout"**, where their energy **flares out of control**.
- Some warriors become **aggressive, reckless, or disconnected from reality** while in this state.

---

### ** 4. Aftereffects ("Post-Ascension Crash")**

- The body **requires time to recover** after shutting down Ascension Drive.
- **Common Side Effects Include:**
  - Extreme **fatigue & muscle failure**.
  - Temporary **energy depletion**.
  - **Severe pain** due to overworked nerves and muscles.
  - In rare cases, **temporary loss of abilities** while the Core rebalances.

---

## ** Variations of Ascension Drive** _(Advanced & Unstable Forms)_

### **1. Hyper Ascension Drive ("Overdrive Form")**

- A **more refined version**, where the user learns to control **100% energy flow** without reckless power spikes.
- **Pros:** Lasts longer, increases power efficiency, and has **fewer post-crash side effects**.
- **Cons:** Takes **years of training** to master.

---

### **2. Core Fracture Ascension ("Unstable Burst Form")**

- An **uncontrolled surge state** where the Core is pushed beyond 100%, risking **permanent damage**.
- **Pros:** Grants an **exponential increase in power**, surpassing even Hyper Ascension Drive.
- **Cons:** Highly unstable—most who enter this state **suffer long-term damage or even death**.

---

### **3. Resonant Ascension ("Dual-Core Synchronization")**

- Only achievable by **hybrids or those with shared energy links**.
- Two or more beings synchronize their Cores, achieving a **harmonized, amplified state**.
- **Pros:** Greater efficiency, more stability, and shared energy pools.
- **Cons:** If synchronization is lost, the resulting energy backlash **affects both users**.

---

## **🔹 Who Can Enter Ascension Drive?** _(And Why Some Can't)_

### ** Who Can Achieve It:**

- **Ulverse Elves, Humans, and Hybrids** with **highly trained Life Cores**.
- **Warriors, explorers, and energy-sensitive individuals** who learn to push their limits.
- Those with **strong emotional triggers**—rage, determination, or desperation can force activation.

### ** Who Cannot Use It:**

- **Most non-organic beings (Mechromorphs, AIs, etc.)** as they lack a Life Core.
- **Certain mutated or unstable Life Cores**, which cannot handle rapid energy expansion.
- **Weakened or elderly individuals**, unless they have exceptional Core resilience.

---

## ** How Ascension Drive Affects Fighting Styles**

- **Swordmasters & Bladesmen:** Their reaction time increases so much that they can **perceive and counter attacks mid-swing**.
- **Martial Artists & Brawlers:** Physical movements become **fluid and hyper-efficient**, reducing wasted motion.
- **Energy Casters & Spell Users:** Their energy techniques are amplified, allowing them to **release techniques beyond their normal limits**.

---

## ** Notable Users & Masters of Ascension Drive**

### **1. The Legendary Warlord Vel’Raith** _(First Recorded User)_

- Used Ascension Drive to **single-handedly defeat an armada**.
- Died due to **Core Fracture Ascension**, his Core collapsing from overuse.

### **2. Red Palette** _(Mastered Hyper Ascension Drive)_

- Refined his Ascension state to prevent **post-crash weakness**, allowing him to sustain it longer.

### **3. Kaylus & The Grand Architect** _(Unique Cases)_

- Kaylus’ energy signature hints at **a different version of Ascension Drive**, possibly **evolving into something more stable**.
- The Grand Architect’s nature suggests he may **bend the rules entirely**, altering the effects of energy overdrive states.

- “She walked the line between **Zeythra Ascent** and a full **Frayborn Surge**… terrifying.”
- “Achieving **Celestive Coreweave** is like grasping the very weave of existence itself.”

Since Ulversian Elves, Humans, and Hybrids are entirely composed of **Ulverse energy**, their **internal structures function differently** from those of purely biological beings. Their bodies are stabilized through **energy-formed organs**, which regulate various aspects of their **power, perception, and existence**.

---

## **🔹 Energy-Based Organs of Ulversians**

While they resemble biological beings externally, their internal anatomy is composed of **energy constructs**, shaped and stabilized by their **Life Core**. These organs are **semi-physical**, meaning they can adapt, reconfigure, and sometimes even regenerate differently than organic equivalents.

### **🔻 1. The Life Core (Energy Heart)**

- The **center of their existence**, located in the chest.
- Regulates **all internal energy functions**, distributing power throughout the body.
- **Damage to the Life Core can lead to energy destabilization, unconsciousness, or disintegration.**

### **🔻 2. The **Flux Arteries** (Energy Circulatory System)**

- Instead of blood vessels, Ulversians have **Flux Arteries**, which carry **pure Ulverse energy** throughout the body.
- These arteries glow faintly beneath the skin, especially when **using abilities or exerting force**.
- Unlike blood, **energy flow can be redirected consciously** to enhance certain parts of the body.

### **🔻 3. The **Astral Lung System** (Energy Respiration & Adaptation)**

- Converts ambient **Ulverse energy into a stabilized form** the body can use.
- Allows them to **adapt to any environment** (space, water, toxic atmospheres) without suffocating.
- **Inhales air only for speech production**, not for survival.

### **🔻 4. The **Echo Core** (Sensory Processing & Perception)**

- Located behind the eyes and ears, this organ **converts sensory data into energy-based perception**.
- Grants enhanced awareness, including **energy detection, spatial awareness, and resistance to illusions**.
- **Ulverse Elves have more refined Echo Cores**, giving them heightened sensory precision.

### **🔻 5. The **Aether Nodes** (Energy Storage & Combat Enhancement)**

- Small, **secondary power centers** distributed throughout the body.
- Act as **energy reservoirs**, storing extra energy for later use.
- When damaged, energy regeneration slows, reducing power output.

### **🔻 6. The **Harmony Core** (Emotional Regulation & Energy Stability)**

- A secondary core located in the **abdomen or lower torso**.
- Helps maintain **emotional balance**, preventing energy surges or loss of control.
- **Overuse of power can destabilize the Harmony Core, leading to energy backlash.**

## **🔹 Hybrid Categories & Unique Evolutions**

Over the years, interbreeding between **Ulversian Elves, Humans, and other entities** has led to the emergence of **specialized hybrid categories**, each with distinct abilities.

### **🔻 1. Starborn Hybrids**

- Descendants of **Ulversians and Cosmic Entities** (like Aspharions or celestial beings).
- Have **greater cosmic energy adaptability**, allowing them to traverse dimensions more freely.
- Often develop **glowing patterns on their skin** that shift based on their energy state.

### **🔻 2. Echo-Walkers**

- Born from **Ulversians and Reality-Warping Entities**, such as beings that manipulate time or perception.
- Can instinctively **phase between realities** or alter their own perception of time.
- However, they are **prone to slipping into unstable states**, requiring training to control their form.

### **🔻 3. Wildborn Hybrids**

- Descended from **Ulversians and primal, beast-like entities**, such as shape-shifters or nature spirits.
- Have **enhanced physical traits**, such as **claws, tails, or heightened reflexes**.
- Some retain the ability to **shift between humanoid and bestial forms**.

### **🔻 4. Voidbound Hybrids**

- The rare offspring of **Ulversians and beings tied to the Void or entropy-based energies**.
- Their energy naturally **counteracts corruption** but is also **unstable under extreme conditions**.
- Many develop **unique core abilities**, such as energy negation or the ability to interact with "dead zones" where energy does not flow.

### **🔻 5. Soullinked Hybrids**

- Created when **an Ulversian bonds their Life Core to another entity**, merging their essences permanently.
- Have **two energy signatures**, allowing them to access **dual power sets**.
- Can communicate with their linked partner telepathically, even across vast distances.

### **Ulversian Elves, Humans, and Hybrids – Anatomy & Physiology**

Ulversian **Elves, Humans, and Hybrids** all share a **common anatomical foundation**, with a few **key differences in physical characteristics and abilities**. Their **bodies are entirely composed of Ulversian Energy**, sustained by their **Life Cores**—the energy centers that **define their existence and sustain their physical forms**.

Unlike standard organic beings, Ulversians interact with reality **in a way that allows them to shift, adapt, and survive in diverse environments**. Their connection to **Ulverse energy** grants them **unique physiological traits**.

---

## **🔹 General Anatomy (Common to All Three Races)**

### **🔻 1. Life Core – The Energy Heart**

- The **Life Core** is a **luminescent, crystalline structure** located deep within the torso, typically **near the sternum or slightly lower**.
- It **stores, regulates, and distributes Ulverse energy**, maintaining the body's structure and functions.
- If severely damaged, the **body destabilizes** and may **disperse into raw Ulverse energy**.
- A **weakened core** leads to **fatigue, loss of abilities, and physical instability**.

### **🔻 2. Ulverse Energy Physiology**

- Since **their bodies are made from Ulverse energy**, they do not rely on **biological processes like cellular respiration or traditional metabolism**.
- Instead, they sustain themselves by **absorbing ambient energy** from their surroundings.
- **Eating and drinking** helps them **replenish energy levels** rather than provide physical sustenance.
- **Their energy naturally adapts to the local universe**, changing their **appearance or power set** to align with their environment.

### **🔻 3. Breathing & Speech**

- While they **do not require oxygen to survive**, they **inhale air to produce speech**, using it to **vibrate their vocal structures**.
- They can exist in **vacuum, toxic environments, or underwater** without issue.
- However, in **universes where air plays a role in sound transmission**, they still **simulate breathing** to communicate.

### **🔻 4. Immortality & Regeneration**

- **Ageing is entirely tied to their energy state**, meaning they do not age **biologically** like normal organisms.
- Damage to their **flesh or organs** can regenerate **if their Life Core remains intact**.
- Minor injuries heal rapidly, but **severe damage can require external energy replenishment or rest**.
- Some individuals **train their cores to accelerate regeneration**, while others may require outside assistance.

### **🔻 5. Energy-Based Nervous System**

- Instead of **biological nerves**, their bodies use **energy pathways** connected to their Life Core.
- This allows **instantaneous reaction times**, making them **faster and more efficient** than standard biological creatures.
- They can **sense energy fluctuations** around them, including **lifeforms, technology, and cosmic shifts**.

## **🔹 Additional Biological Aspects**

### **🔻 1. Diet & Energy Consumption**

- Eating is **not a necessity** but helps **replenish energy faster**.
- Ulversians can **absorb energy directly from their environment**, but food **provides condensed energy sources**.
- **Foods high in natural energy (like cosmic fruits, rare meats, or infused liquids)** are especially beneficial.

### **🔻 2. Mother’s Milk & Infant Energy Stabilization**

- **Infants are still developing their Life Core stability**, meaning their energy is **fragile and fluctuating**.
- A **mother’s milk carries stabilized Ulverse energy**, acting as a **regulator** for the child's forming energy pathways.
- This ensures **a child's body stabilizes properly**, preventing energy instability or **accidental disintegration**.

### **🔻 3. Body Density & Strength**

- Despite their **organic appearance**, their bodies are **denser than most physical matter**, giving them **greater durability**.
- This density also means they are **naturally stronger**, even without enhanced energy states.

### **🔻 4. Environmental Adaptability**

- When traveling to other universes, their **bodies automatically adjust their energy** to match the local reality.
- This can result in:
  - **Physical appearance changes** (new skin tones, eye colors, or body proportions).
  - **Power reconfiguration** (abilities altering to fit the local energy system).
  - **Temporary restrictions** (some abilities weakening or vanishing in low-energy worlds).
- **Core Adaptation Training** can help **retain abilities** across different realities.

## **🔹 Potential Weaknesses & Limitations**

- **🔻 Energy Overuse** → Excessive power use can **drain the Life Core**, requiring rest or external energy absorption.
- **🔻 Core Instability** → If their energy fluctuates too much, they can enter a **weakened state**.
- **🔻 Extreme Reality Shifts** → Universes with conflicting energy laws can **force drastic changes in their form and abilities**.
- **🔻 Forced Core Extraction** → If an enemy attempts to **remove or corrupt** a Life Core, the Ulversian will become unstable or even perish.
