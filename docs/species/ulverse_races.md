All three races are born from The Ulverse Core, a massive star-like power source existing at the heart of their galaxy. Eons ago, this core fragmented, creating intelligent beings capable of harnessing its energy. Each race is an extension of the core’s essence, their appearances and abilities shaped by the way they channel and interpret this energy.

- To blend with universal inhabitants, their default forms closely resemble humans but are marked by faintly glowing eyes, skin tones with subtle iridescence, and an aura of warmth that reflects their star-bound origins.
- When in this form, their star-cores are concealed deep within their chests, radiating a faint hum that’s only perceptible during moments of intense emotion.

### Additional Notes:

- **Connection to the Ulverse Core**: Each race views the Ulverse Core differently:
  - **Ulverse Elves** see it as a spiritual entity, a guide for enlightenment and harmony.
  - **Ulverse Humans** see it as a source of raw potential, a tool for progress and survival.
  - **Astral Kin** perceive it as a part of themselves, a living reminder of their unity and individuality.

### **Unified Ulverse Society: The Stellar Concord**

The Ulverse society operates as a **harmonious collective**, emphasizing balance, duty, and the maintenance of cosmic stability. Their unified culture revolves around their shared origin from the Ulverse Core and their mission to safeguard and optimize the flow of universal energy. They combine aspects of governance, science, spirituality, and martial prowess into a highly structured yet fluid hierarchy.
