### Universal Errors

'Universal Errors' are less of a species and are more of a blanket term to reffer to certain beings of many species who have specific attributes.
The term is used to refer to those whose code has become unstable or corrupted.
Ulversian beings with life cores (Ulverse Humans,Elves and Hybrids) cannot become Universal Errors due to the energy that makes up their bodies tethering them to the Ulverse core,
although their energy can still become unstable it isn't permanant like with other races.
