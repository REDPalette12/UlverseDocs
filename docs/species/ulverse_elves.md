Ulverse Elves

- Appearance:

  - Tall and slender, with symmetrical, almost otherworldly beauty.
  - Their features are more refined than humans, and their hair can shimmer subtly, reflecting light like a nebula.
  - They can shapeshift to alter their gender, grow wings, tails, or animalistic features to suit specific environments or interactions.

- Abilities:

  - Shapeshifting: Limited but versatile. They can change facial features, skin tone, and appendages, and mimic others with high precision. This makes them adept at espionage and diplomacy.
  - Lightcraft: They weave light into illusions, disguises, or physical constructs such as weapons or barriers.
  - Empathic Harmony: Their connection to the Ulverse Core allows them to influence emotions and align energy flows in others.

- Culture:

  - A society of wanderers and diplomats, they see themselves as caretakers of the universal balance.
  - Highly artistic, they use their light-weaving for storytelling, diplomacy, and creating bonds between civilizations.

- Weakness:
  - Their shapeshifting and illusions consume energy rapidly, making overuse dangerous. If their core dims, they lose their form and must retreat to recharge.
