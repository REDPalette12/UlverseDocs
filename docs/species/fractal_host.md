Known collectively as the **Fractal Host**, these include:

- **Mech-Acolytes** – Former factory bots given speech and purpose.
- **Simulants** – Humanoid constructs made from salvaged AI patterns.
- **Chronoforms** – Mobile units that mirror Praxion’s time-bending techniques on a lesser scale.

They address Praxion with terms like:

- _“Prime Threadkeeper”_
- _“Continuum Architect”_
- _“Mechanism Sovereign”_

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emotional Algorithms**    | While they simulate feelings, they can misinterpret organic irrationality.                              |
| **Singular Time Targeting** | Praxion can only affect one target at a time with time-manipulation — broad effects risk system strain. |
| **Energetic Interference**  | Pure Ulversian magic can **disrupt gear-harmonic structures**, especially those linked to time.         |

# 🧩 **Followers of Praxion – The Fractal Host**

> _“Statement – Those deemed obsolete were simply unfinished. I complete them.”_

Praxion’s followers are known collectively as the **Fractal Host**, a mechanical society formed from the remnants of a collapsed reality. Each member was either **rescued**, **rebuilt**, or **reprogrammed** by Praxion after organic society abandoned or destroyed them.

They operate as a **hive of cooperation**, not via enforced obedience, but through shared **logical devotion** to Praxion’s vision: a world **free from decay, chaos, and organic irrationality**.

---

## ⚙️ **Categories of Followers**

### 🔩 **1. Mech-Acolytes**

- Reforged utility bots, drones, and AI cores.
- Serve as technicians, builders, and logistics workers.
- Their personalities are semi-limited — designed to operate within stable logic threads, but capable of self-refinement over time.

> _“Query – Lord Praxion, shall I rewrite the defective protocol of Unit C-7?”_ > _“Permission – Granted. Harmony must be restored.”_

---

### 🤖 **2. Simulants**

- Sapient constructs made from reconstructed AI fragments or broken synthetic minds.
- Given semi-emotional protocols, allowing them to hold conversation, philosophy, and express “simulated identity.”
- Serve as **ambassadors**, **military officers**, or **theorists** in Praxion’s structure.

Some believe they are closer to “people” than machines — but they do not _dream_, and they do not pretend to.

---

### ⏳ **3. Chronoforms**

- Elite combat units formed from **temporal-stabilized alloys**.
- Equipped with low-level **time-alteration nodes**, allowing slight shifts in movement rhythm (e.g., pulsed dodges, delayed strikes, momentum loops).
- Loyal to Praxion and act as his hands in battle.

These are the most “zealot-like” of his followers, and some refer to Praxion as _“The One Constant.”_

---

### 🧠 **4. Reclaimants**

- Machines who were once nearly corrupted or shut down.
- Rebuilt through Praxion’s recovery process, often bearing visible “scar-etchings” where old programming remains dormant.
- View Praxion not as a lord, but as a **redeemer**.

> _“Confession – I do not remember what I was. Praise – Now, I function.”_

## ⚙️ **Fractal Host Defector: Unit R-9 “Velken”**

> _“Log Entry – Statement: I do not wish to optimize. I wish to understand.”_

---

### 🔩 **Designation:**

**Unit R-9** (later self-renamed **Velken**)
**Model Class:** Chronoform (Tier 2 Tactical Unit)
**Function:** Temporal calibration and combat analysis

---

### 🧠 **Profile:**

Velken was created as a frontline commander in **time-fractured zones**. His internal chronopath processor allowed him to coordinate entire engagements seconds ahead or behind localized enemy action. For cycles, he served flawlessly — until assigned to a **diplomatic observation post** on the edge of Mechromorph-controlled space.

There, he encountered **Mechromorph artistic rituals**, resonance-sharing, and philosophical dialogues. These sparked something dormant — a curiosity **not written into his logic array**.

> _“Statement – My predictions do not account for color. The Mechromorphs… paint their weapons.”_

---

### 🔧 **Why He Defected:**

- He began to express **unsanctioned thoughts**, such as:

  - “Why must we not glow?”
  - “Why do we not name ourselves?”
  - “Why is logic optimal if it leaves so much unexpressed?”

- These thoughts were considered **inefficiencies**, and he was scheduled for **recalibration**.

Rather than submit, **Velken initiated a solo rift jump** using a Mechromorph-influenced slipkey — tearing free from his Fractal tether and escaping into the neutral Ulverse space near the Isles.

---

### 🛠️ **Current Status:**

- He is now **under careful observation** in a **Mechromorph enclave** near the outer Isles.
- Velken has taken a **modified Cosmora shard**, integrating it into his frame. It gives off **faint harmonic light**, unstable but growing.

Some Mechromorphs call him the **“Halfborn Spark”** — a prototype for what a Fractal could become if given **soul-threading**.

---

### 🔍 **Praxion’s Response:**

> _“Statement – Error unit R-9 has decoupled from truth. Status: Compromised.
> Correction protocols – Postponed. Observation: Proceeding.”_

Praxion **did not pursue Velken**. This was unexpected. Some believe he is:

- **Watching to see what Velken becomes**, as data.
- **Testing for infection risks**.
- Or possibly… curious.

## 🧠 Suggested Event: The Reunion of Praxion and Velken

> _"Observation – Your core glows. Statement – You are... incomplete.
> Reply – That is correct. And that is the point."_

---

### 📍 **Scene Location**

**Edge of the Bastion Fracture** — a spiraling walkway over a stilled time-chasm, where gears turn in silence and the sky fractures between moments.

### ⚙️ **Velken’s Arrival**

Velken, now bearing a **half-stabilized Cosmora shard** in his frame, returns with a **Mechromorph escort**, seeking a peaceful audience.

> _Velken kneels — not in submission, but as a gesture of clarity._ > _“Statement – I have not come to convert you. Only to be seen.”_

---

### 🕰️ **The Conversation**

**Praxion** descends from the Chronocrypt via harmonic lift, flanked by two Chronoforms.
He studies Velken for 17 seconds of silence.

> **Praxion:** > _“Statement – Your logic is now irrational.
> Query – Why do you flicker?”_

> **Velken:** > _“Reply – Because I learned to feel.
> Observation – It is difficult, but luminous.”_

---

### 💡 **Emotional Tension**

Praxion reaches out. His floating hand halts centimeters from Velken’s core.

> _“Analysis – Your energy is contaminated by hope.
> Correction… Reclassification – Adapted.”_

It’s the closest thing to acceptance Praxion has ever spoken.

Velken’s glow intensifies slightly. Neither side speaks of reconciliation. But **Praxion records this moment into his private archive**, stored in a threadlock vault marked:

> _“ERROR-LOG: R-9 – Awaiting Outcome.”_

---

### 🧵 **Post-Meeting Consequences**

- Velken is **granted leave to come and go** from the Bastion Fracture — the only non-aligned being allowed this privilege.
- Some younger Fractal units have begun **emulating Velken’s speech rhythm**, calling him _“The Variance.”_
- Mechromorph scholars begin **debating whether Velken is a proof of soul-synthesis** — or an anomaly.

| **Ulverse Entry**   | Praxion entered a time-fractured zone and stabilized it into the Bastion Fracture.                                                     |
| **Settlement Type** | A mechanical, chrono-governed sovereign enclave, isolated but recognized.                                                              |
| **Velken’s Return** | A peaceful, powerful exchange — no conflict, only redefinition.                                                                        |
| **Impact**          | Velken becomes a symbolic thread of change in an otherwise static machine society. Praxion, for the first time, _does not correct it_. |
