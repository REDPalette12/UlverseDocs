### **The Collective Existence: The Multifold Unity**

The beings known as the _Collective Existence_ are rare and extraordinary entities within the Ulverse. They are characterized by possessing a singular consciousness that spans across multiple bodies. Each body functions autonomously to some extent but remains tethered to the hive-like mind, sharing thoughts, senses, and experiences instantaneously. These beings are often highly respected, sometimes feared, and always enigmatic, with a deep understanding of both individuality and unity.

### **Recruitment and Creation of New Collective Existences**

- Collective Existences are rare and typically occur as a result of extraordinary events, such as experiments with cosmora energy, failed magical rituals, or unique cosmic phenomena.
- New Collectives can form when a single consciousness is divided across multiple bodies due to accidents involving the Ulverse Core or significant dimensional shifts.
- While they are not intentionally created, researchers like Red Palette and Lan study their formation to better understand the balance of individuality and unity.
