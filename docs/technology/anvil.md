### **A.N.V.I.L.**

**(Accelerated Neutralization Via Interdimensional Laser)**

- **Appearance:**  
  A.N.V.I.L. resembles a sleek, floating, metallic ring roughly 10 feet in diameter, with a hollow center through which its laser fires. The device is composed of Cosmora-infused alloys and inscribed with glyphs that glow faintly when activated. Around its circumference are several rotating energy conduits, each housing a miniature particle acceleration core similar to the V.O.R.T.E.X. but significantly scaled down. When deployed, it hovers autonomously, scanning its surroundings with a lattice of holographic sensors.

- **Functionality:**  
  A.N.V.I.L. specializes in precise strikes, designed for neutralizing specific targets in combat scenarios where collateral damage must be minimized.

  - **Targeting Precision:** Its holographic sensor array analyzes enemy weaknesses and calculates the optimal angle of attack.
  - **Interdimensional Laser:** Unlike V.O.R.T.E.X., A.N.V.I.L.â€™s laser penetrates across dimensional boundaries, allowing it to eliminate foes that attempt to teleport or phase shift to avoid attacks.
  - **Rapid Deployment:** It can be deployed by Watchers or Ulversian forces in hostile environments, either carried by ships or activated from stationary points.

- **Use Case:**

  - **Anti-Warship Device:** A.N.V.I.L. is often used to target enemy starships or large constructs with surgical accuracy.
  - **Battlefield Command Tool:** Deployed to eliminate command units or disrupt high-value enemy assets without harming surrounding allies.

- **Ethical Considerations:**  
  A.N.V.I.L. is less controversial than V.O.R.T.E.X. due to its precision, but some factions worry about its potential misuse, especially against key political figures or civilian targets.
