### Gravity Resonance Advanced Vector Engine

**Acronym-**G.R.A.V. Engine

**Primarily used by-**

- Capital Ships
- Larger space vessels
- Large vessels in general

**Scientific Explanation**
Generates thrust by manipulating local gravity fields, allowing ships to move without ejecting mass.
The engine uses pulsing gravity distortions to pull or push against the surrounding space.
This is used to hover in ports and above sities when needing to stay stationary or at times when very little movement is required.
Ships with GRAV-THRUST engines can hover effortlessly over planetary surfaces.
Requires less energy than conventional thrusters for large ships.

**Limitations**

- Less effective in **high-gravity zones** where gravitational distortions are harder to control.
