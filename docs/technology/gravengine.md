### **2. GRAV Engine** _(Gravity Resonance Advanced Vector Engine)_

- **Used by:** **Capital ships, larger space vessels, and some ground-based hovercraft**
- **How It Works:**
  - Generates thrust by **manipulating local gravity fields**, allowing ships to move **without ejecting mass**.
  - The engine uses **pulsing gravity distortions** to pull or push against the surrounding space.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Works in both space and atmospheric flight**.
  - Ships with **GRAV-THRUST engines can hover effortlessly** over planetary surfaces.
  - Requires **less energy than conventional thrusters** for large ships.
- **Limitations:**
  - Less effective in **high-gravity zones** where gravitational distortions are harder to control.
