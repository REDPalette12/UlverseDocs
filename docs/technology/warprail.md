### **5. WARP-RAIL Drive** _(Warp-Accelerated Relativistic Pathway – Railway Integration Network)_

- **Used by:** **Ulversian Warp Drive Trains**
- **Purpose:** A specialized warp system that allows **trains to use Jump Gates in stations** for **seamless interdimensional travel**.
- **Key Features:**
  - Forms a **stable warp pathway** between two Jump Gates.
  - Prevents **Warp Drift by using pre-encoded track paths** in the Highway.
- **Limitation:**
  - **Cannot free-jump** like a RIFT-SYNC Drive—must follow designated tracks.
