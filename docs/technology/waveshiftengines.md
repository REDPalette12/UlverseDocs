## **üîπ 3. WAVESHIFT ENGINES** _(Exotic, High-Tech Propulsion for Advanced Vessels)_

### **üîª Full Name:** **Waveform-Encoded Phase Displacement Drive**

- **Used by:** **Experimental ships, elite warships, stealth vessels, and aquatic Codehoppers**.
- **How It Works:**
  - This system **does not physically push water aside** but rather **phases the ship into a state where water resistance no longer affects it**.
  - The ship generates a **localized energy field that shifts its molecular alignment**, allowing it to move through water **as if it were air**.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Key Features of Waveform & Phase-Shift Drives**

- **Near-Zero Water Resistance:** Ships can travel at **unbelievable speeds**, surpassing even the fastest hydrojets.
- **Silent & Undetectable:** Since the ship is not **displacing water conventionally**, it leaves **no wake, making it functionally invisible**.
- **Allows for Sudden Directional Shifts:** Unlike traditional thrusters, these ships can **change direction instantly**.

#### **üõ∏ 3A. VEIL-TIDE PHASE DRIVES** _(For Advanced Stealth Submarines & Espionage Ships)_

- Makes the ship **completely undetectable** by sonar or visual tracking.
- Can **phase in and out of reality briefly**, allowing for **teleportation-like repositioning**.

#### **üê¨ 3B. AQUA-FRACTAL DISPLACEMENT SYSTEM** _(For Experimental Vessels & Codehopper-Class Watercraft)_

- Used by **some Codehoppers that operate in underwater regions**.
- Temporarily shifts the ship into a **fractal-based energy state**, making it move as **a distortion rather than a solid object**.
