## **üîπ 2. AQUA-GRAV Engines** _(Buoyancy-Controlled Movement for Large Ships & Mechs)_

**üîª Full Name:** **Aqua-Gravity Resonance Drive**

- **Used by:** **Capital ships, floating cities, massive oceanic transports, and underwater mechs.**
- **How It Works:**
  - Uses **gravitational field generators** to manipulate **buoyancy and mass distribution**.
  - Allows **massive ships to float effortlessly** and smoothly transition between **deep-sea and surface-level operation**.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Key Features of Aqua-Grav Drives**

- **Zero-Drag Movement:** No need for traditional thrusters‚Äîships "sink" or "rise" by adjusting their **gravitational field balance**.
- **Adaptive Pressure Control:** Allows ships to **resist deep-sea pressure** without needing excessive hull reinforcement.
- **Hybrid Functionality:** Some Aqua-Grav ships can **lift partially out of the water**, acting like a hybrid **hovercraft-submarine**.

#### **üö¢ 2A. GRAV-WAVE FLOATERS** _(For Massive Oceanic Cities & Floating Settlements)_

- Used for **ocean-based habitats, floating spaceports, and ultra-large cargo ships**.
- Can hover **just above the ocean surface**, making them **immune to tsunamis and high waves**.

#### **ü§ñ 2B. PRESSURE-LOCK GRAVITY ENGINES** _(For Deep-Sea Mechs & Heavy Machinery)_

- Specialized for **underwater excavation, mining rigs, and industrial mechs**.
- Creates an **adaptive gravitational bubble**, allowing for stable movement in extreme depths.
