## **üîπ 1. HYDROJET Engines** _(Fast, High-Speed Propulsion for Submersibles & Surface Ships)_

**üîª Full Name:** **Hydro-Dynamic Jet Propulsion System**

- **Used by:** **Submarines, underwater fighters, aquatic drones, hoverboats**
- **How It Works:**
  - Instead of burning fuel like a traditional jet engine, **Hydrojet Systems use energy pulses to ionize and accelerate water molecules**, pushing the craft forward.
  - This creates a **high-speed water stream**, allowing for rapid movement underwater.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Subtypes of Hydrojet Systems**

#### **üö§ 1A. TIDAL-JET ENGINES** _(For Surface Ships & High-Speed Watercraft)_

- Designed for **speedboats, water skimmers, and naval craft**.
- Uses **low-resistance water displacement** to reach **high speeds over water surfaces**.
- Some models allow for **brief hovering** by temporarily converting to **anti-gravity lift**.

#### **üåä 1B. RIFT-TIDE ENGINES** _(For Deep-Sea Combat Ships & Submarines)_

- Generates a **contained water vortex behind the ship**, allowing it to **sustain fast movement** without external drag.
- Can create **silent movement modes**, perfect for **stealth missions**.
- Often paired with **adaptive hull technology** to reduce friction.

#### **üê† 1C. BIO-MORPHIC HYDROJETS** _(Inspired by Natural Marine Life)_

- Used on **Nyxara-designed vessels** and organic-based aquatic ships.
- Mimics the **fluid propulsion of marine creatures**, allowing for **smooth and undetectable movement**.
- Ships using this system move **more like living creatures** than mechanical vehicles.

### **4. HYDRO-JET Systems** _(For Underwater & Amphibious Flight)_

- **Used by:** **Ships that operate in oceanic and submerged environments**
- **How It Works:**
  - Creates thrust by **supercharging and ionizing water molecules**, generating an **energy pulse that propels the ship forward**.
- **Key Features:**
  - Perfect for **deep-sea operations**, including **submersible battleships**.
  - The energy used also **powers underwater shields** to prevent pressure damage.
- **Limitations:**
  - **Ineffective in space**‚Äîmust use a secondary **GRAV-THRUST system** for non-aquatic movement.
