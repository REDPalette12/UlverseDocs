### Hydro-Dynamic Jet Propulsion System

**Acronym-** HYDRO-JET Engine

**Primarily used by-**

- Speed boats
- Submarines
- Aquatic drones

**Scientific Explanation**
Instead of burning fuel like a traditional jet engine, Hydrojet Systems use energy pulses to ionize and accelerate water molecules, pushing the craft forward.
This creates a high-speed water stream, allowing for rapid movement underwater.
Perfect for deep-sea operations, including submersible battleships.
The energy used also powers underwater shields to prevent pressure damage.

**Limitations**
Ineffective in space or atmosphere â€” must use a secondary GRAV-THRUST system for non-aquatic movement.

_Variation Designs:_
TIDAL-JET ENGINES _(For Surface Ships & High-Speed Watercraft)_

- Designed for speedboats, water skimmers, and naval craft.
- Uses low-resistance water displacement to reach high speeds over water surfaces.
- Some models allow for brief hovering by temporarily converting to anti-gravity lift.

RIFT-TIDE ENGINES _(For Deep-Sea Combat Ships & Submarines)_

- Generates a contained water vortex behind the ship, allowing it to sustain fast movement without external drag.
- Can create silent movement modes, perfect for stealth missions.
- Often paired with adaptive hull technology to reduce friction.

BIO-MORPHIC HYDROJETS _(Inspired by Natural Marine Life)_

- Mimics the fluid propulsion of marine creatures, allowing for smooth and undetectable movement.
- Ships using this system move more like living creatures than mechanical vehicles.
