### Phase-Shifted Waveform Drive

**Acronym-** PHASE-WAVE Engine

**Primarily used by-**

- Experimental craft
- Smaller rescue craft

**Scientific Explanation**
The ship generates a series of phased energy waves in front of itself, then "falls" forward into the space it continuously creates.
Unlike traditional thrust, it does not "push" a ship but instead "shifts" it forward.
Almost frictionless movement, allowing for insane speed potential.
Can phase through minor obstacles or debris.

**Limitations**

- Requires constant calibration â€” if the energy wave misaligns, the ship may experience a "Phase Stall," causing it to drift without propulsion.
