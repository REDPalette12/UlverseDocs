### **3. PHASE-WAVE Propulsion** _(Phase-Shifted Waveform Drive)_

- **Used by:** **Experimental high-speed ships, certain Ulversian warships**
- **How It Works:**
  - The ship generates **a series of phased energy waves** in front of itself, then "falls" forward into the space it continuously creates.
  - Unlike traditional thrust, it does not **"push"** a ship but instead **"shifts"** it forward.
- **Key Features:**
  - Almost **frictionless movement**, allowing for **insane speed potential**.
  - Can phase through **minor obstacles or debris**.
- **Limitations:**
  - Requires **constant calibration**â€”if the energy wave misaligns, the ship may experience a **"Phase Stall," causing it to drift without propulsion**.
