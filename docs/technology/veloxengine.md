### **1. VELOX Engine** _(Vector-Encased Lightflow Oscillation X-Engine)_

- **Used by:** **Fast-moving atmospheric and space vessels (e.g., Codehoppers, starfighters, interceptors)**
- **How It Works:**
  - Generates **thrust by bending and accelerating light energy** through a contained **high-density Ulversian energy field**.
  - Instead of using traditional thrust, it creates a **continuous "lightflow stream" behind the ship**, propelling it forward with extreme efficiency.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Zero-mass acceleration** â€“ allows instant movement with no inertia drag.
  - **Perfect for dogfighting** due to near-instant maneuverability.
  - Works equally well **inside an atmosphere or in space**.
- **Limitations:**
  - Requires **constant energy input from CCE or CSE systems**.
  - Loses efficiency in environments with **strong electromagnetic disturbances**.
