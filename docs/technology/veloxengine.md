### Vector-Encased Lightflow Oscillation X-Engine

**Acronym-** V.E.L.O.X. Enigine

**Primarily used by-**

- Small atmospheric vessels
- Small space and orbit vessels
- Small hover vehicles
- Codehopper vessels

**Scientific Explanation**
Generates thrust by bending and accelerating light energy through a contained high-density Ulversian energy field
Instead of using traditional thrust, it creates a continuous "lightflow stream" behind the ship, propelling it forward with extreme efficiency.
These trails have been mistaken for shooting stars on planets and areas that are not aware of our ship's existence

- **Zero-mass acceleration** â€“ allows instant movement with no inertia drag.
- Perfect for dogfighting due to near-instant maneuverability.
- Works equally well inside an atmosphere or in space

**Limitations**

- Requires constant energy input from CCE or CSE systems.
- Loses energy efficiency but still funtions in environments with strong electromagnetic disturbances.
