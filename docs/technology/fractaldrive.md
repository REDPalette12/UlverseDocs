### Fractalised Reality Accelerated Collapse & Transport Linked-Jump Drive

**Acronym-** F.R.A.C.T.A.L. Jump-Drive

**Primarily used by-**

- Codehoppers
- Large vessels of all types

**Scientific Explanation**\
Unlike Rift-Sync Drives or Ulversian Highway navigation, which require massive power draws, the Fractal-Jump Drive operates on a localized manipulation of space-time itself, drastically reducing the energy needed for travel.
When travelling the F.R.A.C.T.A.L. Drive flattens and folds space in on itself, causing areas a very long ways away become much closer. It then manipulates this folded space to 'teleport' to another location.
The ship's Fractal Field temporarily breaks spatial continuity, allowing it to "fold" through itself instead of moving through traditional distances.
The ship remains in reality, but its relative position becomes undefined —this lets it bypass conventional motion and reappear elsewhere almost instantly.
Since the ship is not physically moving but repositioning itself in space, travel appears instant to outside viewers.
Unlike creating a personal Rift Gate, which requires a Codehopper to tear open a stabilized rift, the FJ Drive only repositions local space, making it vastly more efficient for frequent jumps.
Since the ship passes through normal space, it cannot be tracked during the jump, making it ideal for stealth movement.
Because the Codehopper never enters the Ulversian Highway, it does not suffer from Warp Drift anomalies or misplaced exits.

**Limitations**

- Unlike the Ulversian Highway, which allows for near-infinite distances, the Fractal Jump Drive is limited to a few light-years per jump.
- Multiple jumps are required for long-haul travel, but this is still far more efficient than traditional warp drives.
- The FJ Drive only works within a single universe—to leave a universe, a Codehopper must use its Rift Gate Generator.
- If a Codehopper experiences a malfunction mid-jump, it may temporarily become "lost between spatial states", appearing as a glitching afterimage across multiple locations before re-stabilizing.
- Some Codehoppers vanish entirely when their FJ Drive fails, though whether they are destroyed or merely misplaced is unknown.
