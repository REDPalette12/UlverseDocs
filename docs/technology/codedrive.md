### **2. CODE Drive** _(Compressed Overdimensional Entry Drive)_

- **Used by:** **Codehoppers** _(personalized, matter-displaced ships)_
- **Purpose:** Creates **a personal Jump Gate** for Codehoppers, allowing them to **fly through their own rift** rather than instantaneously teleporting.
- **Key Features:**
  - Allows **smooth and controlled** entry into the Ulversian Highway.
  - Uses **Ultraversal-Matter Displacement** to **shrink the vesselâ€™s mass** before entering the portal.
- **Limitation:** Cannot perform **instant jumps** like RIFT-SYNC drives; requires **time to generate a stable Jump Gate**.
