## **🔹 2. CSE SYSTEM – Crystal Storage Energy System**

**🔻 Full Name:** **Crystal Storage Energy System**

- **Primary Function:** **Compact energy storage** for **smaller vehicles, weapons, and personal technology**.
- **Used By:** **Small ships, hovercars, combat vehicles, handheld weapons.**

### **⚙️ How It Works**

1. **Pre-Conversion Process:**
   - Unlike **CCE systems, which extract and convert raw energy on demand**, **CSE systems use pre-charged Cosmora Crystals**.
2. **Stored Energy Deployment:**
   - The **stored energy functions like a high-density battery**, allowing for easy replacement or recharging.
3. **On-Demand Power Release:**
   - Energy can be drawn instantly when needed, making it ideal for **weapons, small ships, and portable tech**.

### **🔋 Key Features & Advantages**

- **⚡ Compact & Portable** – Can fit in **small ships, ground vehicles, and even handheld devices**.
- **🔄 Easy Recharge & Swap** – CSE energy cells can be **recharged or replaced**, similar to batteries.
- **🔋 Low Power Waste** – Stores energy **without loss over time**, ensuring efficiency.

### **❗ Drawbacks & Limitations**

- **⚡ Lower Power Capacity** – Cannot sustain **large ships or cities** like CCE systems.
- **🛠️ Needs Frequent Recharge/Replacements** – Once depleted, the crystals must be **swapped out or recharged**.
- **🔥 Limited Energy Surge Ability** – Cannot handle **massive energy spikes** like a CCE system.

### **🔻 Specialized CSE Variants**

#### **1. CSE-ARC (Adaptive Recharge Cell)**

- A **self-recharging** version that can absorb **ambient energy** to extend its lifespan.
- Used in **small recon drones, handheld energy weapons, and personal tech**.

#### **2. CSE-DYN (Dynamic Core Boost)**

- Provides **temporary power surges**, useful in **combat scenarios**.
- **Drawback:** Overuse can **shorten the lifespan** of the crystal.
