### **8. PHASE-VORTEX Drive** _(Phase-Linked Vortical Transit Energy Exchange)_

- **Used by:** **First-generation Warp Trains & planetary defense ships**
- **Purpose:** Allowed for **controlled low-energy warp jumps** between close-range locations.
- **Why It Was Replaced:**
  - **Inconsistent warping**â€”some ships would phase in slightly off-course.
  - Could only function in **regions with pre-existing warp resonance**, limiting its usage.
