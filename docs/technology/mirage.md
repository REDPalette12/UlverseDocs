### **M.I.R.A.G.E.**

**(Multiverse Incineration Reactive Accelerator for Ground-level Eradication)**

- **Appearance:**  
  M.I.R.A.G.E. comes in two primary forms:

  - **Handheld Version:** Resembles a long, intricately designed rifle with a cylindrical core housing a miniaturized Cosmora crystal reactor. Its barrel features a series of concentric rings that rotate and lock into place when charged. A holographic display near the handle shows charge levels and targeting information.
  - **Vehicle-Mounted Version:** A bulkier version designed for vehicles, it features stabilizing arms and a cooling system that allows for continuous firing in high-intensity battles.

- **Functionality:**  
  M.I.R.A.G.E. is versatile and devastatingly effective in ground combat, designed to operate in multiverse-scale conflicts.

  - **Incineration Beam:** Fires a concentrated, high-energy beam capable of disintegrating heavily armored targets and large groups of enemies.
  - **Reactive Accelerator:** Adjusts the beam’s intensity and spread dynamically, switching between a narrow, penetrating shot for single targets and a wide-area effect for groups.
  - **Portable Power Core:** The Cosmora crystal reactor ensures that M.I.R.A.G.E. can operate independently for extended periods without recharging.

- **Use Case:**

  - **Ground-Level Eradication:** Used by elite forces for eliminating entrenched enemy positions, fortified structures, or groups of invaders.
  - **Anti-Voidspawn Tool:** Particularly effective during the War of the Shining Vortex for combating the voidspawn and other entities created by Umbra’s influence.

- **Ethical Considerations:**  
  M.I.R.A.G.E.’s portability and destructive power make it a dangerous tool if it falls into the wrong hands. Strict protocols govern its use, and only trusted personnel are authorized to wield it.
