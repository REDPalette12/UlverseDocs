### **2. AEGIS-WALK Engine** _(Adaptive Energy-Guided Intelligent Stabilization Walker)_

- **Used by:** **Mechs, walking battle machines, and exo-suits**
- **How It Works:**
  - Uses a **fusion of gravitational dampeners and energy-guided kinetic stabilizers** to allow **bipedal vehicles** to move smoothly.
- **Key Features:**
  - Works on **all terrain types**, unlike traditional wheeled vehicles.
  - Allows mechs to **jump, brace, or stabilize their weight dynamically**.
- **Limitations:**
  - Requires **constant energy input** to maintain balance, making it **high-power-demanding**.
