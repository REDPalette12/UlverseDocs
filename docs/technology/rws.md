### **Resonance Weapon System (RWS)**

**Concept Name:** **Sonic Resonance Arsenal (S.R.A.)**  
**Development Catalyst:** The backlash against destructive V.O.R.T.E.X. technology led to the creation of a more precise, non-lethal weapon system. These soundwave-based weapons focus on incapacitation, control, and selective structural neutralization rather than outright destruction. Developed by **Voltt** in collaboration with **Red Palette’s Research Division**, they are highly versatile and adaptable to various tactical needs.
