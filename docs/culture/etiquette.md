# ✨ **Ulversian Etiquette & Hospitality**

> _“Every thread that crosses yours has meaning. Let it leave grace, not damage.”_

---

## 🌿 **General Hospitality (Everyday Interaction)**

Ulversians see hospitality as an extension of **harmonic alignment** — treating others in a way that respects their energetic presence.

| Gesture                                                         | Meaning                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Offering threadwater** (a lightly charged fluid)              | Universal sign of welcome. Enhances core stability in new environments.                               |
| **“Open Threads” hand gesture** (palm over heart, then outward) | Indicates you offer no manipulation, no domination — your energy is open.                             |
| **Inviting someone to your Harmonspace**                        | The highest casual sign of trust — your harmonspace is the attuned zone around your home/living area. |

### ✨ **Hosts Will Often:**

- Offer a **comfort item** (such as a personal resonance cloth or calming harmonics).
- Tune ambient lighting or energy fields to match the **guest’s core profile**.
- Refrain from touching, standing too close, or altering temperature/space without checking first — **personal fields are sacred**.

## 🧷 **Casual Social Etiquette**

| Behavior                | Expectation                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interrupting speech** | Very frowned upon — especially if the speaker is mid-thread (conveying a layered emotional/energetic message). |
| **Energy flaring**      | Raising one’s voice or core-light in public is seen as _emotional pollution_ — except in emergencies.          |
| **Gifts**               | Small thread-woven tokens are common, often resonating with shared memories or color themes of friendship.     |
| **Harmonic Listening**  | Nodding isn't common — instead, the listener subtly pulses their resonance to show active attention.           |

---

## 🧭 **Formal Etiquette (Ceremonial or Diplomatic Settings)**

> _“A thread speaks through posture, not just words.”_

In formal environments, Ulversians emphasize **precision, grace, and restraint**.

### 🎖️ **Standard Formal Practices:**

| Custom                          | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Three-Step Bow**              | Slight lean with arms folded at the waist, followed by a pulse of core-light — a show of mutual harmonic awareness.                                                  |
| **Introducing Core Name First** | In formal settings, one states their **energy-name** or **core resonance title** before their given name (e.g., “Thread of Silence, I am Selana Vryn”).              |
| **Silence Before Speech**       | Pausing before answering shows you’ve weighed the question deeply.                                                                                                   |
| **Threadcloak Etiquette**       | Cloaks or robes worn in court or council must be adjusted to reflect energy openness (pinned forward means _present and active_, pinned back means _observer only_). |

## 🔒 **Special Rules When Meeting Powerful Beings (Aspharions, High Council)**

| Rule                                                                                                 | Why                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No direct core-mirroring**                                                                         | It’s disrespectful to mirror an Aspharion’s energy patterns unless invited. |
| **Remain thread-still** when Solvas Tyre or Alythra speaks                                           | Movement or core-flare is interpreted as argumentative resonance.           |
| **Only speak in thread-pairs** when answering a direct harmonic question (e.g., emotion + intention) | Pure factual answers are considered too hollow in these moments.            |

---

## 🧼 **Guest Etiquette for Visitors from Other Universes**

Ulversians are understanding but will provide:

- **Harmonic briefing orbs** near docks or stations.
- **Translated etiquette glyphs** that display reminders in visual, auditory, or emotional formats.
- **Watcher-hosts** (non-combat staff of the Watcher Knights) who help visitors navigate situations politely.

Missteps are **not punished** unless intentional. However, repeatedly disrupting a harmonic environment may result in **restricted access or guided shadowing**.

## 🌀 **1. Etiquette When Departing (Informal to Formal)**

> _“All threads diverge, but never sever without grace.”_

### ✨ **Informal Departures (Casual Encounters)**

| Gesture or Phrase                                         | Meaning                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hand-to-core pulse** (brief touch to chest/light flare) | "I go in peace; my core remembers this moment."            |
| **“Until the thread calls again.”**                       | Casual goodbye among equals or friends.                    |
| **Turning slightly before walking away**                  | A subtle sign of respect — never exit directly back-first. |

---

### ✨ **Formal Departures (Ceremonies, High Diplomacy)**

| Ritual                               | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spiral Turn & Exit**               | Step back in a soft curve (not a straight line) while bowing — symbolizes letting energy unravel naturally, not abruptly.               |
| **“Let the weave remain unbroken.”** | Spoken to those staying behind — a wish for continued harmony in their space.                                                           |
| **Departure Cloak Pin**              | In highly formal settings, one adjusts the **right cloak pin inward**, showing they are no longer engaged in decision-making or speech. |

---

## 🍽️ **2. Meal Etiquette (Formal, Informal, and Ritual)**

### 🥣 **Informal Meals (Home, ships, or small gatherings)**

- **Guests are seated before food is activated** (especially important with harmonic or rift-prepped meals).
- **No personal resonance flares** during eating — emotional outbursts are seen as disruptive to digestion.
- **Sharing a taste sample** is a sign of friendship or romantic openness.
- **Thread-napkins** are placed over one's **core, not lap** — to shield energy overlap from others during meals.

---

### 🍷 **Formal Meals (Ceremonies, Armistice Dinners, Court Banquets)**

| Rule                                                         | Reason                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speak only when your core-light is dimmed**                | Bright harmonics during formal meals can clash or overwhelm the ambiance. |
| **You must finish your resonance toast** before being seated | This is an emotional harmonic given via speech, not alcohol.              |
| **Eat in spiral order** — outermost foods first, then inward | Reflects order and restraint. Often mirrored in plate design.             |
| **Never cross your utensils**                                | Crossing is symbolic of tension or challenge.                             |

---

### 🎉 **Ritual or Celebration Meals**

- **Each guest brings a single glowfruit, threadwoven treat, or symbolic dish**
- Dishes are placed on a **weave-circle table**, which turns slowly during the meal.
- **No one eats until the Threadcall is spoken** (a short spoken gratitude recitation led by the host or highest-ranking guest).
- **Plates glow in sync** when all guests are aligned emotionally — the host may call this the "Glow of Good Company."

---

## 🎊 **3. Celebration Etiquette (Birthdays, Triumphs, Unity Events)**

> _“Celebration is how we thread joy into memory.”_

- **No core flare limits** — this is one of the few times when expression is encouraged to be visible.
- Guests often **present gifts tuned to the honoree’s resonance** — not valuable objects, but meaningful harmonics, images, stories, or small creations.
- Dancing is always **spiral-based** (circular motions or in-place gestures), never linear — reflecting unity and continuity.
- If singing, **everyone harmonizes around the core tone of the honoree**, creating a collective soundscape.
- At Unity Anniversaries, couples may **reactivate their Unity Mark glow** in front of others to reaffirm it.

## ⚔️ **4. Aurorian Armada Etiquette (Rank, Conduct, and Shared Space)**

### 🧭 **Speaking to Superiors**

| Action                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-thread nod** (subtle, angled nod with light pulse from chest) | Equivalent of a respectful salute.                                                              |
| **“Command thread acknowledged.”**                                     | Used when receiving an order.                                                                   |
| **Never speak while their insignia is glowing**                        | Officers’ insignias glow during decision-making focus — interrupting is _deeply inappropriate_. |

| **Positioning**: Never walk beside a superior unless invited — **one half-step behind** is default.

---

### 🎖️ **To Peers or Same-Rank Officers**

| Rule                          | Custom                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reciprocal pulse greeting** | Both officers raise hands to shoulder, then outward in sync.                |
| **“Aligned in orbit.”**       | Casual phrase signifying mutual rank and role respect.                      |
| **Avoid core peacocking**     | Flaunting visible power or threadmarks is seen as insecure, not impressive. |

### 🛡️ **General Conduct Aboard Armada Vessels**

| Etiquette                                           | Purpose                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No corridor vocal commands**                      | Use light signals or harmonics — shouting is disruptive to core-sensitive equipment.                                         |
| **Wipe resonance at the door**                      | A short pulse into the doorway scanner that smooths personal harmonics — standard when entering command decks or rest areas. |
| **Respect Coremarks**                               | Never touch or comment on another’s Coremark unless in ceremonial context.                                                   |
| **Meal etiquette is respected even during wartime** | This is **non-negotiable** — even field rations are consumed in silence or in harmonic sync.                                 |
