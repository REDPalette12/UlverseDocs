# ‚ú® **Ulversian Etiquette & Hospitality**

> _‚ÄúEvery thread that crosses yours has meaning. Let it leave grace, not damage.‚Äù_

---

## üåø **General Hospitality (Everyday Interaction)**

Ulversians see hospitality as an extension of **harmonic alignment** ‚Äî treating others in a way that respects their energetic presence.

| Gesture                                                         | Meaning                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Offering threadwater** (a lightly charged fluid)              | Universal sign of welcome. Enhances core stability in new environments.                               |
| **‚ÄúOpen Threads‚Äù hand gesture** (palm over heart, then outward) | Indicates you offer no manipulation, no domination ‚Äî your energy is open.                             |
| **Inviting someone to your Harmonspace**                        | The highest casual sign of trust ‚Äî your harmonspace is the attuned zone around your home/living area. |

### ‚ú® **Hosts Will Often:**

- Offer a **comfort item** (such as a personal resonance cloth or calming harmonics).
- Tune ambient lighting or energy fields to match the **guest‚Äôs core profile**.
- Refrain from touching, standing too close, or altering temperature/space without checking first ‚Äî **personal fields are sacred**.

## üß∑ **Casual Social Etiquette**

| Behavior                | Expectation                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interrupting speech** | Very frowned upon ‚Äî especially if the speaker is mid-thread (conveying a layered emotional/energetic message). |
| **Energy flaring**      | Raising one‚Äôs voice or core-light in public is seen as _emotional pollution_ ‚Äî except in emergencies.          |
| **Gifts**               | Small thread-woven tokens are common, often resonating with shared memories or color themes of friendship.     |
| **Harmonic Listening**  | Nodding isn't common ‚Äî instead, the listener subtly pulses their resonance to show active attention.           |

---

## üß≠ **Formal Etiquette (Ceremonial or Diplomatic Settings)**

> _‚ÄúA thread speaks through posture, not just words.‚Äù_

In formal environments, Ulversians emphasize **precision, grace, and restraint**.

### üéñÔ∏è **Standard Formal Practices:**

| Custom                          | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Three-Step Bow**              | Slight lean with arms folded at the waist, followed by a pulse of core-light ‚Äî a show of mutual harmonic awareness.                                                  |
| **Introducing Core Name First** | In formal settings, one states their **energy-name** or **core resonance title** before their given name (e.g., ‚ÄúThread of Silence, I am Selana Vryn‚Äù).              |
| **Silence Before Speech**       | Pausing before answering shows you‚Äôve weighed the question deeply.                                                                                                   |
| **Threadcloak Etiquette**       | Cloaks or robes worn in court or council must be adjusted to reflect energy openness (pinned forward means _present and active_, pinned back means _observer only_). |

## üîí **Special Rules When Meeting Powerful Beings (Aspharions, High Council)**

| Rule                                                                                                 | Why                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No direct core-mirroring**                                                                         | It‚Äôs disrespectful to mirror an Aspharion‚Äôs energy patterns unless invited. |
| **Remain thread-still** when Solvas Tyre or Alythra speaks                                           | Movement or core-flare is interpreted as argumentative resonance.           |
| **Only speak in thread-pairs** when answering a direct harmonic question (e.g., emotion + intention) | Pure factual answers are considered too hollow in these moments.            |

---

## üßº **Guest Etiquette for Visitors from Other Universes**

Ulversians are understanding but will provide:

- **Harmonic briefing orbs** near docks or stations.
- **Translated etiquette glyphs** that display reminders in visual, auditory, or emotional formats.
- **Watcher-hosts** (non-combat staff of the Watcher Knights) who help visitors navigate situations politely.

Missteps are **not punished** unless intentional. However, repeatedly disrupting a harmonic environment may result in **restricted access or guided shadowing**.
