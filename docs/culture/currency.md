# âœ¨ **Ulversian Currency System**

## **Primary Currency: Solvance**

- **Name:** **Solvance** (singular: **Solva**, plural: **Solvance**)
- **Material:** **Compressed Auracite threads** â€” a crystallized form of pure, stable Ulverse energy woven into tangible, flexible sheets or filaments.
- **Appearance:**
  - Shimmering, semi-transparent ribbons or chips that hum faintly with internal light.
  - When you fold a Solva sheet, it softly resists â€” symbolizing that energy, like life, flows and resists chaos.

---

## **Why Solvance?**

- **It's both a currency and a minor energy source.**
- It represents **potential** rather than just abstract value â€” you can either **spend it** or **use it** (though burning Solvance for energy is discouraged unless in emergencies).
- Solvance can be **woven into clothing, jewelry, architecture, or tech** as a sign of wealth or power.

# ðŸŒŒ **Cultural Aspects of Currency**

- **Hoarding Solvance without using it for creation or community aid is seen as stagnating your thread.**
- **Weaving a Solva ribbon into a gift** shows **trust and blessing** â€” it's not just wealth, it's shared destiny.
- Major institutions (like Core Sanctums, universities, and shipyards) have **Solva-threaded crests** at their entrances.

Would you like next:

- **Black market or rare materials economy** (for Codehoppers and treasure seekers)?
- **Examples of legendary purchases** (like buying an entire floating forest)?
- **Special ceremonial uses of Solvance** (like "Founder's Threads" for starting new cities)?

This world is becoming so _alive_ â€” and adding economy/richness makes it feel even more real!  
Which direction would you like to expand into next?
Absolutely! Good catch â€” youâ€™re right: since **Spiral** is already your **year/time unit** in the Ulverse, we should avoid using it again for money. We want the **currency system** to stay **clear, elegant, and distinct**.

# âœ¨ **Updated Ulversian Currency Value Units**

Keeping with the flowing, energy-threaded naming conventions, hereâ€™s a refined version:

| **Currency Unit** | **Name**    | **Meaning / Feel**                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Base unit         | **Luma**    | (Kept â€” it's elegant and fits!) Small pulses of value, daily transactions.                                                           |
| 100 Luma          | **Veil**    | Threads covering larger needs (medium purchases).                                                                                    |
| 1,000 Luma        | **Crysta**  | Major, crystalline milestone of value â€” perfect for bigger investments.                                                              |
| 100,000 Luma      | **Veythra** | ("Vey" meaning weave, "thra" meaning light) â€” monumental levels of stored energy-value. Used for corporate holdings, shipyards, etc. |

### **So Now:**

| Amount                   | Name                                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 Luma                   | Basic unit.                                                    |
| 100 Luma = 1 Veil        | Light-tier purchases (luxury items, tools, advanced services). |
| 1,000 Luma = 1 Crysta    | Significant assets (housing, ships, business starts).          |
| 100,000 Luma = 1 Veythra | Large estates, fleets, planetary industries.                   |

# âœ¨ **Setting the Conversion Rate**

Since Solvance represents **not just money**, but also **stable, condensed energy**, it would naturally be **more valuable than standard Earth currency**.  
Let's treat 1 **Luma** like something between a **pound and a few pounds** depending on energy density.

Hereâ€™s a **realistic, lore-respecting conversion**:

| **Ulversian Currency**       | **Approximate GBP Value** | **Notes**                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 Luma**                   | Â£2 GBP                    | Basic everyday unit; buy a meal, a tool, basic transport fare.                              |
| **1 Veil (100 Luma)**        | Â£200 GBP                  | Equivalent to buying good-quality gear, a short trip ticket, a low-tier piece of tech.      |
| **1 Crysta (1,000 Luma)**    | Â£2,000 GBP                | Significant purchases â€” cheap vehicles, modest homes, basic ships.                          |
| **1 Veythra (100,000 Luma)** | Â£200,000 GBP              | Monumental transactions â€” estates, entire shipyards, or startup capital for fleet-building. |
