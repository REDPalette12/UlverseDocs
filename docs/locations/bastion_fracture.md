## 🏙️ **The Fractal Bastion**

Praxion's domain is a **vast mechanical arcology**, suspended within fractured time.

- Towers rotate on slow gears.
- Civilian machine forms go about structured tasks in perfect harmony.
- Defensive units operate in **choreographed movement**, triggered by Praxion’s corebeat.

# 🛠️ **Location: The Bastion Fracture**

After escaping their dying dimension, Praxion and the Fractal Host settled in an area of the Ulverse known as the **Bastion Fracture** — a shattered region **tethered by temporal threads**, slowly stabilized through Praxion’s intervention.

### 📍 **The Bastion Fracture Features:**

- **Floating gear-platform cities**, suspended in time-fractured zones.
- **Spiral engine rings** that process raw matter into programmable materials.
- **Distortion halos** where local time shifts unpredictably — now contained by chrono-pillars built by the Host.
- A massive **central structure** known as the **Chronocrypt** — part citadel, part archive, part memorycore for Praxion’s consciousness.

**Visitors are tolerated**, but only if they follow logical behavioral protocol — emotion-based actions are monitored closely.
