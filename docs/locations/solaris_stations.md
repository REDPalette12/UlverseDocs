## **🔹 Structural Design & Rotating Ring Functionality**

Each Axis-Station is a **colossal megastructure**, often rivaling **entire cities** in size. While individual stations vary, all share the **defining feature of a massive, slowly rotating ring** surrounding the station’s core.

### **⚙️ The Rotating Ring – Purpose & Functionality**

- **Gravity Stabilization:** The ring generates **simulated gravity** for areas within the station that require it, allowing for **a seamless blend of artificial gravity and weightless environments**.
- **Energy Distribution:** The ring acts as a **giant Ulversian energy conductor**, channeling and storing **power from Cosmora crystals** to sustain the station.
- **Highway Synchronization:** Serves as a **warp transit stabilizer**, ensuring safe entry and exit points for **Warp Drive Trains and ships using the Ulversian Highway**.
- **Magnetic Rail System:** Houses **train networks and docking points**, allowing for seamless movement of passengers and cargo across the entire station.
- **Atmospheric Regulation:** The ring contains **massive climate control systems**, ensuring life support functions operate efficiently across living districts.
