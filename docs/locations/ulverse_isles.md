### **The Ulverse Isles**

The **Ulverse Isles** are the heart of the Ulverse itself, a stunning network of **floating islands** suspended over an infinite, glowing ocean known as the **Sea of Eternity**. This central location is both sacred and practical, as it houses the **Ulverse Core**, the source of all energy, life, and magic throughout the multiverse. While the **Capital City of the Ulverse Core** dominates the central isles, other settlements and towns have developed over time, forming a sprawling yet interconnected society.

### **Early Transportation**

Before modern tools like flight equipment or airships:

- **Machina Aeternum** and **Oceanora** relied heavily on ferries.
- **Silvaspire** was accessed via temporary energy pathways or mist-clearing boats.
- **Auranthia** and **Ferryn’s Bridge** had rudimentary skyrails and energy platforms linking them to the capital.

Once **flight spells** and tools like **hoverpacks** emerged, Ulversians gained freedom of movement, integrating these cities into a seamless, dynamic network.

### **Visual Layout Summary**

Imagine a **layered network**:

1. **Top Tier**: Lumina Caelora and key isles like Etheren, Caelum, and Lyssana.
2. **Mid Tier**: Auranthia, Ferryn’s Bridge, Silvaspire.
3. **Lower Tier**: Machina Aeternum and Oceanora near the Sea of Eternity.

This layout allows for easy visualization of the **verticality** and **connectivity** of the Ulverse Isles. Each settlement is carefully placed to fit its function and history.

### **The Beacon of the Lost Ages**

This myth speaks of a time when a mysterious ripple of **time distortion** swept across the Ulverse, causing entire star systems to vanish into a realm known as the **Timeless Abyss**. The distortions threatened to destabilize the Core itself, plunging existence into chaos.

**The Role of the Eternal Lamp**:  
The myth claims that **Red Palette**, the Ulverse Research Department Head, wielded the **Staff of the Eternal Lamp** to illuminate the Timeless Abyss, navigating its labyrinth of paradoxes and forgotten histories. The staff’s light stabilized the rifts, creating a path for Red Palette and his team to recover fragments of lost star systems and guide them back into the Ulverse.

**Outcome**:

- Red Palette’s efforts saved countless lives and preserved the Ulverse Core’s balance.
- The Eternal Lamp became a symbol of guiding even the most hopeless of situations back to safety.
- The phrase “Follow the Lamp” is now used to encourage perseverance through uncertainty.
