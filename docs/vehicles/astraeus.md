### **Red Palette’s Personal Research Vessel: The _Astraeus_**

---

**Overview:**  
The _Astraeus_ is a medium-sized, state-of-the-art airship, uniquely designed for the cutting-edge research and exploration led by Red Palette and his personal team. Built for versatility, the _Astraeus_ functions across land, sea, air, space, and even the interdimensional fabric of the Ulverse. It is equipped to support both theoretical research and practical fieldwork, making it an invaluable asset in scientific discovery and innovation.

### **Exterior Design:**

- **Structure:**  
  The _Astraeus_ is sleek yet robust, resembling a cross between a traditional airship and a modern spacecraft. Its metallic hull is plated with **Spectrite Alloy**, giving it a polished, reflective appearance that shimmers faintly in any light source.

- **Aircraft Bay:**  
  A retractable platform on the ship’s upper deck serves as a landing and parking area for smaller aircraft and drones. This platform can extend outward, transforming into a miniature runway for launching exploration vehicles.

- **Universal Travel Integration:**  
  On either side of the _Astraeus_, large, concentric **warp stabilizers** emit a faint blue glow, allowing seamless interaction with warp gates. These stabilizers anchor the ship during interdimensional travel, ensuring safe passage through rift gates into the Multiversal Highways.

- **Submersible Mode:**  
  Reinforced panels along the lower hull conceal water-tight seals and thrusters that enable smooth underwater navigation. The ship’s design incorporates glowing, bioluminescent strips for illumination in the dark ocean depths.

- **Space-Ready:**  
  A reinforced shielding system protects the ship from cosmic radiation and debris during space travel. The engine exhaust ports on the rear emit a soft purple light, a signature of its **Cosmora Crystal** energy source.

### **Construction and Planning of the _Astraeus_**

#### **Planning Stage:**

The concept for the _Astraeus_ emerged during the early stages of the Era of Reconstruction, when Red Palette envisioned a vessel capable of operating across multiple dimensions, terrains, and atmospheres. Collaborating with Voltt and Vixen from the Development Department, as well as engineers from Machina Aeternum, the project took three decades to complete.

- **Initial Goals:**
  - Enable seamless transition between universes using warp gates.
  - Equip the vessel for field research, with specialized facilities for experimentation and analysis.
  - Ensure adaptability for air, sea, space, and interdimensional travel.

#### **Construction Phase:**

The ship’s hull was constructed from **Spectrite Alloy**, chosen for its durability and lightweight properties. Warp stabilizers and energy conduits were integrated into the framework, powered by an array of **Prismarion Crystals**. Key construction sites included:

- **Machina Aeternum:** Fabrication of the ship’s frame and energy systems.
- **Ulverse Isles Dockyards:** Assembly of external components and integration of Cosmora-based propulsion.
- **Red Palette’s Private Labs:** Development of the experimental Energy Research Chamber and navigation systems.
