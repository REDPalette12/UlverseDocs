### **Glitch Evolution Tiers**

Glitches are categorized by their level of corruption and threat:

1. **Bug:**

   - **Description:** The earliest stage of corruption, often minor disruptions in reality. Bugs may cause small inconsistencies, such as objects shifting positions or repeating events.
   - **Abilities:** Limited manipulation of their surroundings.
   - **Containment:** Easily neutralized using basic containment fields or patches.

2. **Glitch:**

   - **Description:** Mid-tier anomalies that actively disguise themselves and manipulate reality. Glitches are capable of limited possession and environmental distortion.
   - **Abilities:** Can create false realities or small rifts in universal stability.
   - **Containment:** Requires specialized traps and harmonic resonators to weaken their hold on reality.

3. **Error:**

   - **Description:** Advanced entities capable of large-scale corruption. Errors can destabilize universal laws, making areas unpredictable.
   - **Abilities:** Reality-warping, stronger possession abilities, and replication.
   - **Containment:** Requires coordinated team efforts and advanced nullification chambers.

4. **Virus:**
   - **Description:** The apex of glitch evolution, viruses are catastrophic entities capable of collapsing universes. Viruses often manifest as highly intelligent beings.
   - **Abilities:** Full-scale universal corruption, massive possession powers, and the ability to infect other glitches to spread instability.
   - **Containment:** Only the most advanced Codebreakers and equipment can handle viruses. Often requires sacrificial containment methods.
