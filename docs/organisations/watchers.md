While some survivors demanded harsher punishments for the Council, Lan's empathy and persistence eventually swayed many to see him as an ally. This gradual shift laid the groundwork for the eventual transformation of survivors into the **Watchers**.

### **Formation of the Watchers**

Over time, as survivors began to heal, many of them expressed a desire to contribute actively to the safety and stability of the Ulverse. Lan and the High Council saw this as an opportunity to honor their resilience and integrate them into Ulversian society.

---

### **1. Origins of the Watchers**

The survivors proposed the idea of a security force made up of their own people, ensuring no one would ever face the loss of their universe again. Lan supported this proposal and worked with them to establish the Watchers as a unique and vital branch of Ulverse governance.

### **2. Watcher Design**

- **Blind Yet Seeing**:  
   The Watchers voluntarily gave up their physical sight as a symbol of their impartiality and dedication. Through magical augmentation, they gained the ability to "see" through the eyes of others, perceiving intentions, emotions, and magical flows.

- **Masks of the Watchers**:  
   Each Watcher wears a specially crafted mask resembling a pair of watchful eyes. These masks are more than symbolic; they are enchanted items that allow the Watchers to see through the perspective of multiple beings at once, granting them unparalleled awareness.

- **Uniforms**:  
   Watchers wear simple but elegant robes, often in deep blues or blacks, signifying their neutrality and solemn duty. Their masks are adorned with unique designs that reflect their personal histories or the universes they hail from.

- **Ulverse Security**:  
   Watchers patrol dimensions, monitoring for threats such as rogue magic, void corruption, and interdimensional instability.

- **Advisors to the Council**:  
   Their impartial perspective and vast observational reach make them invaluable advisors to the Council of Eight, ensuring that the rulers remain accountable.

- **Guardians of Survivors**:

   A Watcher who specializes in identifying and neutralizing void energy corruption. Orin's mask is adorned with swirling void-like patterns as a reminder of what they lost.

### **Impact of the Watchers**

The Watchers' creation significantly mended the rift between the survivors and the Ulversian rulers. Their presence reassures many that the mistakes of the past will not be repeated.

Lan’s role in their formation cemented his legacy as a ruler who learned from history and actively sought to build a better future. He remained a steadfast supporter of the Watchers, frequently consulting with them and championing their contributions to Ulverse security and harmony.

- When a Watcher retires or is lost in duty, their mask is ceremonially passed to the Hall of Watchers, a repository of masks and histories of all who served. It acts as both a memorial and a source of inspiration for future generations.
