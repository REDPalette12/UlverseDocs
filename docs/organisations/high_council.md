### **Updated Profile: Itheris Voidseer**

- **Role in the High Council**: The Vigilant
- **Ruling Era**: Age of Shadows (prior to the War of the Shining Vortex)
- **Family Name**: **Voidseer**
- **Overview**:  
  Itheris Voidseer was a visionary during the Age of Shadows, a turbulent time when void energy disturbances began increasing across the Ulverse. Though she had long since stepped down as a ruler, her expertise in void energy and dimensional stability became instrumental after the **War of the Shining Vortex**, particularly in containing the aftermath of Umbra’s release.

  Her role as the Vigilant focuses on monitoring dimensional stability, advising on void energy disruptions, and preventing another catastrophe like Umbra's creation.

---

### **Backstory**:

During her rule, Itheris noticed an increase in void energy tears, which threatened the stability of smaller universes within the Ulverse. She pioneered studies into void energy and developed early containment methods, including the **Voidbound Shields**—protective barriers that could stabilize universes with weak dimensional fabric.

Though Itheris had retired by the time of the **War of the Shining Vortex**, her research formed the foundation for the tools and techniques the current Council of Eight used to contain Umbra's overwhelming void energy. Following the war, she was called upon to rejoin Ulverse affairs as a member of the High Council, dedicating herself to preventing such events from happening again.

---

### **Legacy**:

- **Voidbound Shields**:  
  These shields remain the primary method for stabilizing void-corrupted zones, a legacy of her meticulous work.

- **The Umbra Compact**:  
  After the war, Itheris negotiated the protocols by which Umbra, now a reformed but reluctant being, could interact safely with the Ulverse. This includes the monitoring of void energy surges and ensuring the container created to balance Umbra’s energy remains intact.

- **Ethereal Warden Program**:  
  Itheris introduced a specialized branch within the Ulverse Stability Division that trains individuals in monitoring and mitigating void energy threats.

---

### **Personality**:

- **Cautious and Analytical**: Itheris approaches all problems with a meticulous and measured mindset, often warning others of potential long-term consequences.
- **Haunted but Hopeful**: Though she carries guilt over her inability to prevent the circumstances that led to the War of the Shining Vortex, she focuses her energy on ensuring history does not repeat itself.
- **Respected and Revered**: Known as the "Watcher of Shadows," Itheris is held in high regard for her relentless vigilance and tireless dedication to the safety of the Ulverse.

---

### **Interaction with the War of the Shining Vortex**:

- **Post-War Contributions**:  
  After the banishment of the rogue Council member and Umbra's release, Itheris worked closely with the current Council of Eight to stabilize the regions devastated by void energy. She advised on reinforcing containment structures and creating protocols for handling the remnants of Umbra's destructive power.

- **Relationship with Umbra**:  
  Though wary of Umbra, Itheris respects the being's newfound neutrality and keeps an open line of communication with them. Her role is to ensure that Umbra remains a watchful observer rather than a destructive force.

- **Mentor to Modern Vigilants**:  
  Itheris has taken on a mentorship role for those tasked with monitoring void-related anomalies, ensuring that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.

Itheris’s meticulous and enduring work has inspired several myths and stories within the Ulverse:

1. **The Watcher’s Light**:  
   A myth tells of a glowing beacon said to emanate from Itheris's soul, guiding lost travelers through void-tainted regions. Some believe it is her eternal vigilance made manifest.

2. **The Unseen War**:  
   Though not a combatant in the War of the Shining Vortex, tales describe Itheris as fighting an “unseen war” within the fabric of reality itself, battling to prevent universes from collapsing under void energy pressure.

3. **The Vigilant’s Oath**:  
   Many Ulversians recite a variation of Itheris’s famous words: _“To see the shadow and not act is to let it consume the light.”_ This phrase has become a mantra for those in the Ethereal Warden Program.
