### **The Meeting of Vixen and Voltt**

Vixen and Voltt's meeting is the kind of story told fondly within the circles of Machina Aeternum, a blend of humor, intrigue, and destiny.

#### **The Setting**

Before her split from Kaylus, Vixen’s rogue body had already started forging an identity of its own. She was newly independent and eager to explore her individuality, but she had no clear direction. Wandering the Ulverse Isles, she stumbled upon Machina Aeternum, drawn by its vibrant energy and promise of ingenuity. Voltt, meanwhile, was in his early days as a budding inventor, working on his first major project in a cluttered workshop just on the outskirts of the city.

#### **The Meeting**

Vixen had joined a tour group exploring the mechanical wonders of Machina Aeternum, more out of curiosity than genuine interest. She wasn’t exactly captivated by machines, but the enthusiasm of the guide and the crowd intrigued her. The tour ended at an open-air exhibition where inventors showcased their prototypes.

Voltt, as always, had been working tirelessly on a project—a small, self-sustaining drone designed to deliver messages across the Isles. Exhausted but eager, he decided to showcase his work at the exhibition.

As fate would have it, the demonstration didn’t go smoothly. Voltt’s drone malfunctioned, spiraling into the air before colliding with a nearby food cart. The crowd gasped, but Vixen, spotting the humor in the situation, burst into laughter. Her mirth cut through the awkward tension, and as she approached to inspect the drone, she offered a sly remark:

“Well, I think it _definitely_ delivers a message—just not the one you planned.”

Voltt, mortified but intrigued by her boldness, stammered an apology and tried to explain the drone’s mechanics. Vixen, however, wasn’t interested in the machine itself but rather in Voltt’s passion. Something about his quiet determination and understated brilliance struck her as refreshing.
