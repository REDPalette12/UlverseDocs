However, when Riley Non rose to power, implementing policies that tightened control over the outlying settlements, Veyron saw it as a betrayal of Ulversian freedom. He joined a group of dissidents who sought to resist Non’s rule, using guerrilla tactics to disrupt his forces.</p><p>During a high-stakes mission to sabotage one of Non’s supply depots, Veyron and his group were cornered by Non’s elite forces. In a desperate bid to escape, Veyron stumbled upon a <strong>Codehopper</strong>—its owner already incapacitated in the chaos.
