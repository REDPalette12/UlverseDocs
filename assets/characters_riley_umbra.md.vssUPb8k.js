Despite this, he does care for existence and despises liars, especially those whose lies cause harm to many others. He tends to harshly punish those who cause great destruction or harm through their lies. If anyone picks a fight with him he tends to mess with them first before showing them how weak they are in comparison, however due to his &#39;All Seeing Shadow&#39; ability he is able to very accurately discern another&#39;s strength. <br><strong>Strengths:</strong> <br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> <br><strong>Fears/Phobias:</strong> <br><strong>Hobbies &amp; Interests:</strong> <br><strong>Likes:</strong></p><ul><li>Tea, all kinds, but particularly enjoys <br><strong>Dislikes:</strong></li><li>Liars \\</li></ul><h2 id="abilities-skills" tabindex="-1"><strong>Abilities &amp; Skills</strong> \\ <a class="header-anchor" href="#abilities-skills" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Abilities &amp; Skills** \\&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Powers/Special Abilities :</strong></p><ul><li>Shadow telekinesis</li><li>Shadow manipulation</li><li>Shadow inducement</li><li>Shadow movement</li><li>Shadow lightning</li><li>Shadow recruitment</li><li>Shadow leech</li><li>Shadow disguise</li><li>Shadow intimidation</li><li>Shadow barrier</li><li>Shadow foresight</li><li>Shadow stealth</li><li>Shadow manifestation</li><li>Shadow illusion</li><li>Shadow explosion</li><li>Shadow duplicate</li><li>Shadow burst</li><li>Shadow speed</li><li>Shadow portals</li><li>Shadow paralysis</li><li>Shadow realm control</li><li>Shadow control</li><li>&#39;All Seeing Shadow&#39;</li><li>Invisibility</li><li>Intangibility</li><li>Immortality</li><li>Shapeshifting</li><li>One man army</li><li>Black hole creation and manipulation</li><li>Mild mind control</li><li>Light absorption</li><li>Universal lock resistance</li><li>Void black hole creation and manipulation</li><li>Void resistance</li><li>Void command</li><li>Minimal reality warping</li><li>Multiversal radiation resistance</li><li>Ultraversal travel</li><li>Reality shattering</li><li>Regeneration and ageing resistance</li><li>Non-existence</li><li>Minimal matter creation</li><li>Minimal time manipulation</li><li>Unmeasured strength</li><li>Singularity</li><li>Panmnesia</li><li>Ultraversal translation</li><li>Puppeteer</li><li>Perception mirror</li><li>Smoothly spoken</li><li>Void vortex creation and control</li><li>Energy manipulation</li><li>Ability mirror</li><li>Size manipulation</li><li>Ability improvement</li><li>Omnilock</li><li>Absolute darkness</li><li>Absolute erasure</li><li>Multipresence <strong>Combat Skills :</strong></li><li>Weapon mastery <strong>Talents/Professions:</strong></li><li>Superior acting</li><li>Escape artist <strong>Weapons/Equipment :</strong></li><li>Shadow manifestations (can change into all weapon forms)</li></ul><h2 id="social-background-information" tabindex="-1"><strong>Social &amp; Background Information</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#social-background-information" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Social &amp; Background Information**&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Job/Role in Society:</strong> Aspharion of Fear and Void <br><strong>Home/Place of Residence:</strong> <br><strong>Family Members:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="./melaina_umbra">Melaina Umbra</a> (younger sister)</li><li><a href="./ozul_umbra">Ozul Umbra</a> (youngest sibling) <br><strong>Friends/Allies:</strong></li><li><a href="./red_palette">Red Pallette</a></li><li>Riley Lan <strong>Rivals/Enemies:</strong><strong>Love Interest(s):</strong></li></ul><h2 id="backstory" tabindex="-1"><strong>Backstory</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#backstory" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Backstory**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>(A brief or detailed summary of the character’s history, including major life events and how they became who they are.)</p><h2 id="additional-notes" tabindex="-1"><strong>Additional Notes</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#additional-notes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Additional Notes**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Has three forms, his human &#39;Shell&#39; Form, his &#39;Distortion&#39; Form and his True form. <br> To transition from his &#39;Shell&#39; Form to his &#39;Distortion&#39; Form he tears his Sealing core from his chest, and his human &#39;shell&#39; breaks in half and crumbles away, leaving his distortion form. While in his distortion form he retains his human shape but gains his true form&#39;s &#39;shadow&#39; appearance, only his eyes being visible. His main attack while in this form is a mass of hand-Like, shadow appendages that he creates from his shadow body. While in this form he is more aggressive and is usually very narrow minded, not stopping his attack until his target is destroyed. <br> When he first had his void energy sealed within his Sealing Core he was an emotionless being and had to learn about the world around him, similar to a child despite having all the memories of when he was just The Void. It took a while but he eventually got to the point where he understood basic emotions and how to interact with people. He still struggles to this day to discern feelings of love, friendship, happiness and other positive emotions due to the nature of The Void being essentially Anti-matter and as such is the &#39;negative&#39; imprint of reality. This is shown by the fact that he still has a distain for people and the fact that he has very few people that he connects with or gets along with.</p><hr>',21)]))}const p=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{c as __pageData,p as default};
