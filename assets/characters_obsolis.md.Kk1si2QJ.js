When a universe falls into irreversible decay—whether from entropy, unchecked void corruption, or systemic instability—it is Obsolis who ensures its end, making way for new creation and balance within the Ulverse.</p><hr><h3 id="appearance" tabindex="-1"><strong>Appearance</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#appearance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Appearance**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Obsolis does not have a single, definitive form, adapting their appearance based on the universe they visit. However, certain traits remain constant:</p><ul><li><strong>Faceless Visage</strong>: Their &quot;face&quot; is a blank, swirling void, reflecting the infinite potential of destruction and rebirth.</li><li><strong>Shimmering Shroud</strong>: They are cloaked in a flowing mantle of cosmic fragments, resembling the remnants of shattered stars and galaxies, which seem to float weightlessly around them.</li><li><strong>Ever-Shifting Shape</strong>: Obsolis’ body shifts and flows, sometimes humanoid, sometimes a mass of abstract geometry, depending on the onlooker&#39;s perception. Their shape evokes both awe and dread.</li><li><strong>Eyes of Eternity</strong>: When they wish to communicate or make their presence known, Obsolis manifests countless eyes across their form, each resembling galaxies collapsing into black holes.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="personality-and-nature" tabindex="-1"><strong>Personality and Nature</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#personality-and-nature" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Personality and Nature**&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Impartial and Stoic</strong>: Obsolis carries out their duty with neither malice nor joy. They are utterly impartial, viewing their work as a necessity rather than a choice.</li><li><strong>Elusive and Mysterious</strong>: Obsolis rarely communicates, speaking only to those whose understanding is crucial to the balance. Even the Ulverse rulers and the High Council see them as an enigma.</li><li><strong>Burdened Existence</strong>: Though they accept their role, Obsolis is not unfeeling. They carry the weight of their actions, haunted by the echoes of the universes they have unmade.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="abilities" tabindex="-1"><strong>Abilities</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#abilities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Abilities**&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><strong>Cosmic Erasure</strong>: Obsolis can collapse entire universes into singularities, erasing them without a trace. This power is wielded only as a last resort.</li><li><strong>Temporal Manipulation</strong>: They can rewind or fast-forward time within a universe to assess whether it is salvageable. This power ensures no destruction occurs prematurely.</li><li><strong>Dimensional Presence</strong>: Obsolis exists simultaneously across all dimensions, allowing them to appear anywhere without traversing space or time.</li><li><strong>Annihilation Aura</strong>: When destruction begins, Obsolis emits an aura that slowly dissolves the affected universe into raw energy, which is then recycled into the Ulverse Core.</li></ol><hr><h3 id="the-role-of-obsolis-in-the-ulverse" tabindex="-1"><strong>The Role of Obsolis in the Ulverse</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-role-of-obsolis-in-the-ulverse" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**The Role of Obsolis in the Ulverse**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Obsolis is not merely a destroyer; they are a restorer of balance. Without them, dying universes would fester, creating instability that could spread to healthy universes.</p><h4 id="key-responsibilities" tabindex="-1"><strong>Key Responsibilities</strong>: <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-responsibilities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Key Responsibilities**:&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li><strong>Evaluating Universes</strong>: Obsolis visits universes deemed unstable to determine whether they can be saved. If not, they begin the process of unmaking.</li><li><strong>Collaborating with the Ulverse Council</strong>: Though Obsolis operates independently, they occasionally consult the High Council, particularly in cases of moral ambiguity or potential intervention.</li><li><strong>Recycling Energy</strong>: The energy from destroyed universes is absorbed into the Ulverse Core, fueling the creation of new universes.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="backstory" tabindex="-1"><strong>Backstory</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#backstory" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Backstory**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Obsolis was not created but <em>manifested</em> from the Ulverse Core during the Age of Expansion. When the first universes began to collapse under the weight of unchecked growth, the Core birthed Obsolis as a failsafe. They have existed since, ensuring that the Ulverse remains sustainable.</p><h4 id="the-pact-of-necessity" tabindex="-1"><strong>The Pact of Necessity</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pact-of-necessity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**The Pact of Necessity**&quot;">​</a></h4><p>During the <strong>Ulverse Era</strong>, the High Council formally acknowledged Obsolis’ role, creating the &quot;Pact of Necessity&quot; to ensure their actions were bound by strict guidelines. This pact prevents Obsolis from acting on personal judgment, requiring their decisions to align with the Ulverse&#39;s balance.</p><hr><h3 id="significant-events" tabindex="-1"><strong>Significant Events</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#significant-events" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Significant Events**&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="the-shining-vortex-conflict" tabindex="-1"><strong>The Shining Vortex Conflict</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-shining-vortex-conflict" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**The Shining Vortex Conflict**&quot;">​</a></h4><p>During the War of the Shining Vortex, Obsolis was almost forced to destroy several universes overtaken by void energy. However, Umbra convinced them to delay, allowing the Ulverse rulers to intervene and save many of those universes. This rare collaboration showed that even Obsolis could adapt when balance could be restored without annihilation.</p><h4 id="the-fall-of-universalis-13" tabindex="-1"><strong>The Fall of Universalis-13</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-fall-of-universalis-13" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**The Fall of Universalis-13**&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Universalis-13, a once-thriving hub universe, became the first universe Obsolis was forced to unmake after its inhabitants unlocked a device that disrupted the Ulverse Core’s equilibrium. The destruction of this universe remains one of the most studied events in Ulverse history, serving as a grim reminder of the cost of imbalance.</p><hr><h3 id="relationships" tabindex="-1"><strong>Relationships</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#relationships" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Relationships**&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Ulverse Rulers</strong>: Obsolis views the rulers with a mix of detachment and respect, recognizing their efforts to save universes but often stepping in when those efforts fail.</li><li><strong>Umbra</strong>: Obsolis and Umbra share a mutual understanding of their solitary roles in the Ulverse. They occasionally converse, exchanging insights about the nature of existence.</li><li><strong>Ozul</strong>: Obsolis is fascinated by Ozul’s cyclical transformations, seeing them as a living metaphor for the Ulverse’s cycle of destruction and rebirth.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="philosophical-impact-on-the-ulverse" tabindex="-1"><strong>Philosophical Impact on the Ulverse</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#philosophical-impact-on-the-ulverse" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Philosophical Impact on the Ulverse**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The existence of Obsolis raises deep questions about morality, destiny, and the nature of life itself.

The staff’s appearance shifts based on the universe it is used in.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="legends-and-myths" tabindex="-1"><strong>Legends and Myths</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#legends-and-myths" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Legends and Myths**&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>The Whisper of the End</strong>: It is said that when Obsolis is near, the winds carry whispers of the past, as if the universe is saying its final goodbyes.</li><li><strong>The Eternal Judge</strong>: Some cultures view Obsolis as a divine judge who weighs the worth of a universe before deciding its fate.</li><li><strong>Obsolis’ Shadow</strong>: A myth suggests that seeing Obsolis’ shadow means the end of that universe is near, causing mass panic when sightings are reported.</li></ul><hr><p>Obsolis is a being of ultimate responsibility and neutrality, ensuring that even in destruction, the Ulverse remains balanced and prepared for renewal. Their presence, though feared, is a cornerstone of the Ulverse’s stability.</p>',42)]))}const f=s(n,[["render",r]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
