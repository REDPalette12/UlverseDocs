They are as diverse as organic beings, with unique personalities and abilities that reflect the varied roles they play within the Ulverse.</p><hr><h3 id="physiology-and-key-traits" tabindex="-1"><strong>Physiology and Key Traits</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#physiology-and-key-traits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Physiology and Key Traits**&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Cosmora Crystals</strong>:<br> Each Mechromorph possesses a single Cosmora Crystal housed within their core. These crystals not only sustain them but also hold their consciousness, allowing their bodies to function seamlessly. In cases of severe damage or destruction, their personalities and memories can sometimes be transferred to a new body, but this is rare and seen as a significant event.</p></li><li><p><strong>Body Types</strong>:<br> Mechromorphs come in various forms, from humanoid designs to more specialized, tool-like configurations.

From a young age, she showed an uncanny aptitude for both disciplines, blending them seamlessly into new forms of creation. Her unique hybrid heritage gave her the adaptability of Ulverse Humans and the intricate magical intuition of Ulverse Elves, which she used to great effect in her work.</p><p>Aleia became fascinated by the concept of sentience and autonomy within non-organic constructs. She believed that life could exist beyond traditional forms if properly nurtured. Her most ambitious project was the creation of the <strong>Mechromorphs</strong>, which she viewed as a way to bring a new kind of life into the Ulverse while also solving practical problems of maintenance and exploration.</p><hr><h4 id="creation-of-the-mechromorphs" tabindex="-1"><strong>Creation of the Mechromorphs</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#creation-of-the-mechromorphs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Creation of the Mechromorphs**&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Aleia&#39;s breakthrough came with the discovery of <strong>Cosmora Crystals</strong>, a rare energy source resonating with Ulverse magic. She theorized that these crystals, if properly attuned, could house and sustain consciousness. Her initial prototypes were simple constructs meant for repetitive tasks. However, during a critical experiment, the interaction between the Cosmora Crystals and her own magic sparked the first sentient Mechromorph, <strong>Primus</strong>, who became the prototype for all others.</p><p>Aleia worked tirelessly to refine the process, creating diverse body types and personalities for the Mechromorphs. She ensured they had autonomy and free will, rejecting the notion of them being mere tools. Her efforts culminated in the recognition of Mechromorphs as equals by the High Council, an achievement that defined her legacy.</p><hr><h4 id="later-life-and-legacy" tabindex="-1"><strong>Later Life and Legacy</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#later-life-and-legacy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Later Life and Legacy**&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Aleia continued to advocate for harmony between organic and mechanical beings.
