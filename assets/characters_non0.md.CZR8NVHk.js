Known for his sharp mind and groundbreaking discoveries, Non was elevated to a position of power, replacing his predecessor. However, his appointment to the Council marked the beginning of his downfall.</p><p>As a ruler, Non became consumed by his ego, abandoning the responsibilities he had been entrusted with. His neglect and hubris led to catastrophic failures in maintaining universal balance, resulting in the destruction of several universes. Survivors of these universes held him responsible and ultimately revolted, forcing the High Council to intervene. Non&#39;s banishment to the void inadvertently allowed the void being to escape, sparking the War of the Shining Vortex.</p></li></ul><hr><h3 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><strong>Personality</strong>: <a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Personality**:&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Before Power</strong>:<br> Non was known as a creative genius and charismatic leader, admired for his innovative ideas and dedication to advancing the Ulverse’s knowledge.</p></li><li><p><strong>After Gaining Power</strong>:<br> Non’s rise to the Council brought out his darker traits. He became arrogant, dismissive of others, and increasingly self-absorbed, seeing himself as infallible.</p></li><li><p><strong>During the Fall</strong>:<br> Non’s reaction to the revolt was marked by cruelty and desperation. He lashed out at those who challenged him, using his mastery of electricity magic to suppress dissent, earning him infamy among the survivors.</p></li></ul><hr><h3 id="physical-appearance-1" tabindex="-1"><strong>Physical Appearance</strong>: <a class="header-anchor" href="#physical-appearance-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Physical Appearance**:&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Before Fall</strong>: Non appeared polished and regal, with striking silver hair and glowing blue eyes reminiscent of lightning.

The High Council, led by Riley Ulu, stepped in after hearing the pleas of the survivors. Non was summoned to account for his actions but responded with defiance, blaming others for his failures.</p><p>His banishment to the Void was both a punishment and a necessity, as the Council feared he was too dangerous to leave unchecked. Unbeknownst to them, the Void Being capitalized on Non’s magical essence, merging with his body to escape and initiate the War of the Shining Vortex.</p><hr><h3 id="legacy-and-infamy" tabindex="-1"><strong>Legacy and Infamy</strong>: <a class="header-anchor" href="#legacy-and-infamy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Legacy and Infamy**:&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Infamy in History</strong>:<br> Non is remembered as one of the darkest chapters in Ulverse history.

They also introduced measures to evaluate potential rulers more rigorously, emphasizing not only their magical prowess but also their character and dedication to their duties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased Accountability</strong>:<br> Departments like Research and Development were restructured to prevent neglect of universal care.
